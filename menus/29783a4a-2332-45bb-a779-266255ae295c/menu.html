    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Brooklyn Burgers &amp; Beer is a family friendly restaurant and a true “mom and pop.” Owners Ariel and Sherry Solomov are committed to creating a warm and inviting home away from home where you can get-exactly as the logo promises: “crazy good burgers and craft beer.” Emphasis is put on community pride and support by working with seasonal and local ingredients whenever possible. The restaurant’s location in the heart of Park Slope, a community full of quality small businesses and other hardworking entrepreneurs, makes keeping their integrity in this simple.  </p>
    <h3>Opening Brooklyn Burgers and Beer is truly a dream come true for Eric and Sherry.</h3>
      <p>Both have worked in restaurants for much of their lives and when they began dating, cooking and pairing cocktails for each other quickly became a big part of their relationship.  They worked together to design and build the interior (which is literally Eric’s handiwork), create specialty cocktails and burger combinations, and imbue the restaurant with the little touches that make it feel like their second home.  We welcome you to make it yours as well!</p>

	<p>I was in the area and found this burger place so I stopped by for lunch. They have a great list of burgers, and I was being indecisive. I then noticed the sliders option! I thought it was such a great option to have! Why pick when you could have all three (or more)!? I had the beef, turkey, and fish. Mu favorites were the beef and fish. I'm not the biggest fan of fish, but it had a mango salsa and made it so flavorful! Hope to return soon to try more!</p>

	<div class="stars" data-score="5"></div>
	<p>Amazing food, wonderful staff, reasonable prices! Since it opened a few years ago, this place has become one of our neighborhood favorites. It can be crowded during weekend evenings, but it's definitely worth it!</p>

	<h3>Dr RaDra</h3>
	<div class="stars" data-score="5"></div>
	<p>What can I say. I love any place where I can build my own weird burger, where they cook it exactly the way I want, and on top of that staff are super organized and just amazingly friendly. Menu look-up on your phone for minimal contact. They disinfect after every party. Won't eat inside a restaurant at least for another year. They better keep those outdoors tables for a while because I'll be back.</p>

	<p>If you are in the Park Slope area, you definitely need to try this place. The burgers are amazing! I had the B&amp;B Burger and it does not disappoint. The brioche bun is the added bonus to a good beef patty.<br />
Really good quality food. I tried my friend's wings and it was good too. I want to try to soup next time. The food is spot on- I highly recommend it!</p>

	<p>The best representation of an NYC burger, with the burger, fries and wings cooked to absolute perfection. Excellent waiters who could answer all of our questions, made the whole experience that much better. An amazing selection of craft beers to suit every taste and kudos to whoever runs the spotify playlist, really chill vibes. Came here on the recommendation of a Maguire as the best burger in new york and did not disappoint, will definitely be a returning customer<br />

	<div class="stars" data-score="5"></div>
	<p>We were celebrating my brother's birthday yesterday and he was sooo happy! We really enjoyed the food! The appetizers were stupendous and the burgers were phenomenal <em>insert chef's kiss</em> I was really happy to see that they followed the covid guidelines. They measured temperature, the staff was wearing masks and they even had to cups to separate the Sanitized pens and the ones that need to be sanitized which I feel is the first time I've seen that. Another thing that I liked was how they have heaters next to the outdoor seats. My brothers and I were worried at first being cold sitting outside but we were warm and toasty. Overall, very good place and we'll be coming back for more!</p>
