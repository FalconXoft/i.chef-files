After receiving its first Michelin star in 1976, and two more in 1980, the Le Coze&rsquo;s set to open Le Bernardin in New York in 1986. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the unexpected passing of Gilbert in 1994, Maguy Le Coze began working closely with Chef Eric Ripert, a disciple and close friend of Gilbert, who took over the kitchen to continue preparing the freshest seafood with the simple philosophy that the fish is the star of the plate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Le Bernardin earned four stars from The New York Times three months after its opening, never having dropped a star throughout six reviews, and is the only restaurant to maintain this rating for that length of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2011, Le Coze and Ripert unveiled the next chapter in the restaurant&rsquo;s history: a significant redesign from Bentel &amp; Bentel. The new look features a lounge, a first for the restaurant, where a separate menu is available. Since then, the restaurant received a James Beard Award in 2012 for &ldquo;Best Restaurant Design,&rdquo; and an &ldquo;Outstanding Restaurateur&rdquo; award in 2013 for Le Coze, who is the first woman to be honored in the category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restaurant holds several records in New York: it received its four-star review from The New York Times only three months after opening and is the only New York four star restaurant that has maintained its status of excellence for more than 3 decades. Reviews have come in 1986, 1989, 1995, 2005, and most recently in 2012, with the same verdict: four stars. &nbsp;Le Bernardin has received more James Beard Awards than any other restaurant in New York City. In 1998, Maguy Le Coze won the coveted James Beard Award for &quot;Outstanding Restaurant&quot; in America, and in May 2003, the James Beard Foundation named Eric Ripert &ldquo;Outstanding Chef.&rdquo; In 2009, Le Bernardin was honored with the James Beard Award for &ldquo;Outstanding Wine Service.&rdquo; The Michelin Guide, which made its New York debut in 2005, honored Chef Ripert and Le Bernardin with its highest rating of three stars in 2005 and each year thereafter, and the restaurant ranks 26 on the World&rsquo;s 50 Best Restaurants list. The New York Zagat Guide has consistently recognized Le Bernardin as top rated in the category of &ldquo;Best Food&rdquo; and the 2011- 2016 editions awarded it a 29 food rating: the highest in New York City. In the 2012-2014, 2016 &amp; 2017 Zagat Guides, Le Bernardin is named the Most Popular Restaurant in the city, and in the 2015&ndash;2017 guides, it&rsquo;s also rated the city&rsquo;s top restaurant for service. New York magazine also rated Le Bernardin #1 in its annual ranking of the 101 best restaurants in New York City in 2006. In his year-end dining feature, Frank Bruni of The New York Times selected Le Bernardin as the &ldquo;Best Meal of 2008.&rdquo; Most recently for 2019, Le Bernardin was ranked No. 1 in the World by La Liste, the global food guide and review aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, Ripert and partner Maguy Le Coze expanded their business to form Ripert Consulting which so far has shaped restaurants in Florida, California and New York City and has partnered with the Ritz-Carlton to open restaurants in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and the Caribbean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2014, Ripert and Le Coze extended the elegance of Le Bernardin&rsquo;s private dining room with the opening of Le Bernardin Priv&eacute;, a modern and dynamic event space, and Le Bernardin wine director Aldo Sohm opened Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, where guests can enjoy a menu of simple and shareable dishes meant to complement and elevate an extensive and ever-changing wine list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the delight of fans all over the world, 1998 saw the publication of Le Bernardin&rsquo;s first cookbook, called <em>Le Bernardin&mdash;Four Star Simplicity</em>. Eric Ripert has also published a memoir, <em>The New York Times</em> bestseller <em>32 Yolks</em>, and four other cookbooks: <em>My Best: Eric Ripert</em>, <em>Avec Eric</em>,<em> On the Line</em>, and <em>A Return to Cooking</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","path":"/about","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","buttonSwitch1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | About","buttonText1":"","h1":"About","h2":"About Le Bernardin","h3":"","h4":"","checkbox1":0,"showinNav":1,"image1_anchor":"","sortOrder":1,"linkTitle":"Le Bernardin","parentID":0,"template":"about","id":2,"image1":""},{"blurb1":"","path":"/menus","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","buttonSwitch1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | Menus","buttonText1":"","h1":"Menus","h2":"","h3":"","h4":"","checkbox1":0,"showinNav":1,"image1_anchor":"","sortOrder":2,"parentID":0,"linkTitle":"Menus","template":"lander","id":3,"image1":""},{"blurb1":"","path":"/private-dining","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | Private Dining","buttonSwitch1":"","buttonText1":"","h1":"Private Dining","h2":"","h3":"","h4":"","showinNav":1,"checkbox1":0,"image1_anchor":"","sortOrder":3,"linkTitle":"Private Dining","parentID":0,"template":"lander","image1":"","id":4},{"blurb1":"<p>RESERVATIONS: &nbsp; &nbsp;212 554 1515</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reservations open on the first of each month for the following month.

From the hills of Northern Tuscany to the waters of Northern California, find inspiration and creativity in the easy home cooking of the chef and co-owner of New York&rsquo;s Le Bernardin restaurant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>ON THE LINE</strong><br />\r\n<em>by Eric Ripert &amp; Christine Muhlke (Artisan, 2008)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Line is a look at the inner workings of Le Bernardin: the incredible level of personal commitment, discipline, and loyalty; the precise organization and orchestration of the restaurant&rsquo;s operations; the details of hiring and training; the real cost of food; the focused preparation of meals; the expected and unexpected challenges of growing a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facts and figures are all here: the pounds of black bass served each week (500); the average number of minutes it takes to cook a dish (5); the glasses washed by hand each day (1300); the bottles of wine in the cellar (14,000); the monthly flower bill ($12,000); the number of waitstaff who are also actors (0).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Told from the point of view of the principal players&mdash;from chefs to line cooks, from the porter to the ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;, from the sommelier to the captain&mdash;readers will feel the heat, the creativity, and the sense of accomplishment at Le Bernardin, where each year, 150,000 plates are sent from the kitchen to the table. On the Line includes nearly 50 of Eric Ripert&rsquo;s favorite dishes, described from inspiration all the way to execution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A RETURN TO COOKING</strong><br />\r\n<em>by Eric Ripert &amp; Michael Ruhlman (Artisan, 2002)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric Ripert discovered that as he rose to prominence as a chef, he began to drift far, far away from cooking. A Return to Cooking is the antidote. A four-part journey to four different locations over four seasons, the goal of the book was to &ldquo;cook the landscape&rdquo; and &ldquo;cook from the gut,&rdquo; using local, in-season ingredients and experiencing the joys&mdash;and occasional disappointments&mdash;of the spontaneity and creativity that are at the heart of cooking.<br />\r\nRipert often says that much of the best cooking happens at home with family or friends. And so he set off with a group of five friends to do just that. The group not only shopped, cooked, and cleaned up together&mdash;they lived together in four different houses, each of which had a perfectly ordinary kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ripert cooked. Colombian artist Valentino Cortazar sketched and painted. Tammar and Shimon Rothstein photographed. Award-winning author Michael Ruhlman captured the creative process in prose. And Andrea Glick, Ripert&rsquo;s right hand, ensured the recipes ended up on paper so they could be tested and perfected later. Everyone partook, and everyone&mdash;especially Ripert&mdash;learned along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This eminently practical book, with nearly 150 recipes, is also a teaching book; dozens of short essays offer advice on subjects like the handling of raw fish, the power of the vinaigrette, and even the merits of Tabasco, shallots, and lemon confit. And of course, it offers guidance about roasting, seasoning, poaching, and saut&eacute;ing. Every bit as fascinating is the book&rsquo;s bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the magic that is created when decades of cooking experience, the forces of intuition, the music of the season, and the ingredients of the landscape all coalesce.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>LE BERNARDIN: FOUR-STAR SIMPLICITY</strong><br />\r\n<em>by Maguy LeCoze and Eric Ripert (Broadway Books, 1998)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Co-owner Maguy Le Coze traces the roots of Le Bernardin&rsquo;s culinary &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; to her late brother, Gilbert, the restaurant&rsquo;s legendary co-founder and first chef: &ldquo;Gilbert was not a classically trained chef,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He had never been to culinary school. When he cooked, he made things he liked, and things he knew. He focused on the quality and freshness of the fish. He made nages and vinaigrettes because he&rsquo;d never made a hollandaise or a b&eacute;arnaise. He focused on flavors that were delicate, subtle, herb-infused.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Chef Eric Ripert carries on the tradition with simple but nuanced dishes such as Poached Halibut on Marinated Vegetables, Pan-Roasted Grouper with Wild Mushrooms and Artichokes, and Grilled Salmon with Mushroom Vinaigrette. And of course, desserts&mdash;from Chocolate Millefeuille to Honeyed Pear and Almond Cream tarts. Four Star Simplicity offers 100 meticulously formulated and carefully tested recipes, from appetizers through dessert.</p>\r\n","path":"/gifts","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | Gifts","buttonSwitch1":"","buttonText1":"","h1":"Gifts & Books","h2":"","h3":"","h4":"","checkbox1":0,"showinNav":1,"image1_anchor":"","sortOrder":7,"linkTitle":"Gifts","parentID":0,"template":"lander","id":7,"image1":""},{"path":"/privacy-policy","blurb1":"<h2><strong>LE BERNARDIN, INC.

Along with a registration process that uses data encryption, we offer consistently secure, efficient online sessions that allow you to validate your subscription, access your account and retain some personal settings so you can read what you want, the way that you want it. And this is all made possible by cookie technology. Below you&#39;ll find information describing our specific use of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production process and have enabled us to better serve you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&#39;s a cookie?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that&#39;s sent to your computer or other device by a site&#39;s server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Contrary to what you might read elsewhere, cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, destroy files, send you viruses, etc.&nbsp;An important point: <strong>Cookies can only contain as much information as you disclose to the site that sent it to you!</strong>&nbsp;In our case, that means any information included in your subscription form or that you input during the customization of our site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why do you use cookies?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use cookies for basic reasons: To allow you to move more quickly and securely through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter our site, for example, we use a test cookie to confirm your browser&#39;s ability to retain cookies, check our database to verify your subscription and log the Internet protocol (IP) that your session originates from. A cookie is then temporarily &quot;set&quot; within your browser to allow you to proceed -- without having to ask you for your User Name and Password with each subsequent page you request. Without cookie technology, we wouldn&#39;t be able to offer you convenient features such as the ability to store your User Name and Password and save settings for your customized experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what&#39;s in it for me?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of cookies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Faster, more secure access:</strong>&nbsp;So we don&#39;t have to ask you to identify yourself with each new page requested. We can also deliver you customized information and store your settings more efficiently.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Better information:&nbsp;</strong>We want to give you features and services that you&#39;re interested in. By monitoring popular -- and not-so-popular -- features in an aggregate manner, we can better serve your needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So do you track my usage patterns using cookies?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We track the usage of various features within our sites on an aggregate basis and report this to advertisers. However, we do not track your usage or other personal information in any individually identified way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some web browsers may transmit &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals to websites visited by the user.&nbsp; Our information collection and disclosure practices will continue to apply as described in this policy, regardless of any &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals that are sent by certain browsers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will the cookies you send me go away?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the cookies we use are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of the browser session (&ldquo;session cookies&rdquo;). We also use cookies that remain on your hard drive for a certain period of time (between one day and thirty days depending on the cookie) after the browser session. &ldquo;Persistent cookies&quot; are stored on your hard drive and will be deleted by the browser after the given time.&nbsp; You are, of course, free to clear any and all cookies from your hard drive any time you wish. Just search your system for any files named cookie.txt or similar and delete them at your discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So should I surf your site with my browser&#39;s cookie-alert feature activated?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;d recommend that you turn that feature off, perhaps after using the site for a day with it on so you can see our cookies firsthand if you wish. Our use of cookies ultimately helps you have a better experience here. And because we rely on cookies throughout our site, you might find it cumbersome to be alerted to each cookie you&#39;ll encounter. Many of our cookies last only for 12 hours, so you&#39;ll see them every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can I amend my cookie preferences?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can configure your browser settings to accept or reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies that have already been set.

If the restaurant were still like it was the day we opened, it would be old! You must always change &mdash; but subtly.&rdquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maguy Le Coze, co-owner of Le Bernardin, was born in a small fishing village in Brittany, France, where her grandfather was a fisherman and her parents owned the Hotel de Rhuys, a small inn and restaurant. &nbsp;These early years instilled in Maguy an undying love of the sea and a continual appreciation of seafood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time she was a teenager, Maguy was already working in the Hotel de Rhuys&rsquo; dining room, and her brother Gilbert was learning to cook in the kitchen. &nbsp;The siblings so impressed their father with their skills, that he opened La Biscorne, a summer disco, and let Maguy and Gilbert operate it. In the winter, the two traveled to the French Alps to work at popular clubs and restaurants at the ski resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, while Maguy and Gilbert were still in their twenties, they moved to Paris and opened a small restaurant named Le Bernardin, after an order of monks devoted to good wine and food. &nbsp;Maguy and Gilbert borrowed recipes from family members in Brittany, and their parents would gather fresh ingredients, such as wild fennel, to ship to Paris by train. Le Bernardin became one of Paris&rsquo; hottest restaurants. &nbsp;In 1981, Le Bernardin moved to a larger location and a year later, received two Michelin stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expanding on their Parisian success, Gilbert and Maguy opened a second Le Bernardin in New York City in 1986. &nbsp;Just three months later, they received a four-star review from the New York Times, an unprecedented record. &nbsp;After selling the Parisian restaurant to focus on America, the two opened Brasserie Le Coze in Coconut Grove, Florida, which was named one of &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Best 25 Restaurants&rdquo; by Esquire magazine. In 1994, they opened a second Brasserie Le Coze in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the untimely and tragic death of Gilbert in the summer of 1994, Maguy focused her energies on the New York operations. After selling the Coconut Grove restaurant and closing the restaurant in Atlanta, Maguy worked closely with Chef Eric Ripert to uphold<br />\r\nLe Bernardin&rsquo;s tradition of excellence and innovation. Following a significant and striking redesign by Bentel &amp; Bentel in September 2011, Le Bernardin continues to maintain this tradition, simultaneously drawing a new generation of diners while staying true to the artistry and consistency that have made it such a success. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2014, Maguy and Eric opened Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, named for their acclaimed wine director Aldo Sohm, just steps away from Le Bernardin. Set in a casual and convivial room, the wine bar offers a menu of simple, shareable plates meant to complement Aldo&rsquo;s ever-changing, expertly curated wine list. That same month, Maguy and Eric expanded Le Bernardin&rsquo;s private dining offerings with Le Bernardin Priv&eacute;, a dynamic space above Aldo Sohm Wine Bar that can accommodate a range of events, including weddings, cocktail receptions and corporate meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maguy received a 2013 James Beard Award for &ldquo;Outstanding Restaurateur,&rdquo; the first woman ever to be honored in this category. Under Maguy&rsquo;s loving guidance, Le Bernardin continues to receive universal acclaim for its food and service, a testament to its timeless appeal.</p>\r\n","path":"/about/maguy-le-coze","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","buttonSwitch1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | Maguy Le Coze","buttonText1":"","h1":"Maguy Le Coze","h2":"","h3":"","h4":"","showinNav":1,"checkbox1":0,"image1_anchor":"","sortOrder":1,"parentID":2,"linkTitle":"Maguy Le Coze","template":"bio","id":9,"image1":""},{"path":"/about/team","blurb1":"","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","buttonSwitch1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | Team","buttonText1":"","h1":"Team","h2":"","h3":"","h4":"","checkbox1":0,"showinNav":1,"sortOrder":2,"image1_anchor":"","parentID":2,"linkTitle":"Team","template":"lander","id":10,"image1":""},{"blurb1":"<h2>&ldquo;For me, food is about memories, feelings, emotions, and so is Le Bernardin, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not just a restaurant.&rdquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric Ripert is grateful for his early exposure to two cuisines&mdash;that of Antibes, France, where he was born, and to Andorra, a small country just over the Spanish border where he moved as a young child. &nbsp;His family instilled their own passion for food in the young Ripert, and at the age of 15 he left home to attend culinary school in Perpignan. &nbsp;At 17, he moved to Paris and cooked at the legendary La Tour D&rsquo;Argent before taking a position at the Michelin three-starred Jamin. &nbsp;After fulfilling his military service, Ripert returned to Jamin under Joel Robuchon to serve as chef poissonier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, Ripert seized the opportunity to work under Jean-Louis Palladin as sous-chef at Jean Louis at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. &nbsp;Ripert moved to New York in 1991, working briefly as David Bouley&rsquo;s sous-chef before Maguy and Gilbert Le Coze recruited him as chef for Le Bernardin. &nbsp;Ripert has since firmly established himself as one of New York&rsquo;s&mdash;and the world&rsquo;s&mdash;great chefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1995, at just 29 years old, Ripert earned a four-star rating from the New York Times. &nbsp;Twenty years later and for the fifth consecutive time, Le Bernardin again earned the New York Times&rsquo; highest rating of four stars, becoming the only restaurant to maintain this superior status for this length of time, without ever dropping a star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2011, Ripert and Le Coze unveiled a significant redesign of Le Bernardin from Bentel &amp; Bentel that earned the restaurant a James Beard Award for &ldquo;Best Restaurant Design&rdquo; in 2012. The new look features a lounge, a first for the restaurant, where a separate menu is available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later in September 2014, Ripert and Le Coze opened Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, named for the acclaimed wine director Aldo Sohm. Located just steps away from Le Bernardin, the wine bar offers a menu of cheese, charcuterie and simple fare paired with Sohm&rsquo;s curated wine list in a casual, convivial setting. That same month, the two expanded Le Bernardin&rsquo;s private dining offerings with Le Bernardin Priv&eacute;, a dynamic space above Aldo Sohm Wine Bar that can accommodate a range of events, including weddings, cocktail receptions and corporate meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ripert has been recognized as one of the top chefs in the world. In 1998, the James Beard Foundation named Ripert &ldquo;Top Chef in New York City&rdquo;&nbsp;and in 2003, &ldquo;Outstanding Chef in the United States.&rdquo; In September 2009, AVEC ERIC, Ripert&rsquo;s first TV show, debuted on PBS stations and ran for two successful seasons, earning two Daytime Emmy Awards: &ldquo;Outstanding Culinary Program&rdquo; (2011) and &ldquo;Outstanding Achievement in Main Title and Graphic Design&rdquo; (2010). Avec Eric: a culinary journey with Eric Ripert (Wiley) was released in November 2010 with more than 100 recipes inspired by Ripert&rsquo;s travels. AVEC ERIC returned for a third season on the Cooking Channel in February 2015. Ripert has also hosted RESERVE CHANNEL&rsquo;s show &ldquo;On the Table&rdquo; on YouTube, which debuted in July 2012, and appeared on the &ldquo;Late Show with David Letterman,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Charlie Rose Show,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ellen DeGeneres,&rdquo; &ldquo;TODAY,&rdquo; &ldquo;Live with Kelly &amp; Michael&rdquo; and &ldquo;Martha Stewart.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fall 2008, Ripert published On the Line, his second cookbook with Artisan, which in 2002 published A Return to Cooking, a collaboration between Ripert, photographers Shimon and Tammar Rothstein, artist Valentino Cortazar and writer Michael Ruhlman that was selected by Newsweek as one of its best books of the season. &nbsp;Ripert&rsquo;s first cookbook, Le Bernardin &ndash; Four Star Simplicity (Clarkson Potter) debuted in 1998, and in 2014, Ripert released his newest cookbook, My Best: Eric Ripert (Alain Ducasse Publishing). In 2016, he published his memoir: 32 Yolks: From My Mother&rsquo;s Table to Working the Line (Random House), which appeared on The New York Times bestseller list. In addition, Ripert partnered with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company to open Blue in Grand Cayman.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ripert is the Vice Chairman of the board of City Harvest, working to bring together New York&rsquo;s top chefs and restaurateurs to raise funds and increase the quality and quantity of food donations to New York&rsquo;s neediest.

Filled with Ripert&#39;s most personal and defining life moments, 32 Yolks is the first part of his journey to New York City and Le Bernardin.</p>\r\n","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | 32 Yolks","buttonSwitch1":"","buttonText1":"","h1":"32 Yolks","h2":"18.00","h3":"141","h4":"2","showinNav":1,"checkbox1":0,"sortOrder":3,"image1_anchor":"","linkTitle":"32 Yolks","parentID":71,"template":"product","id":80,"image1":""},{"blurb1":"<p><em>by Eric Ripert &amp; Christine Muhlke (Artisan, 2008)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Line is a look at the inner workings of Le Bernardin: the incredible level of personal commitment, discipline, and loyalty; the precise organization and orchestration of the restaurant&rsquo;s operations; the details of hiring and training; the real cost of food; the focused preparation of meals; the expected and unexpected challenges of growing a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facts and figures are all here: the pounds of black bass served each week (500); the average number of minutes it takes to cook a dish (5); the glasses washed by hand each day (1300); the bottles of wine in the cellar (14,000); the monthly flower bill ($12,000); the number of waitstaff who are also actors (0).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Told from the point of view of the principal players&mdash;from chefs to line cooks, from the porter to the ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;, from the sommelier to the captain&mdash;readers will feel the heat, the creativity, and the sense of accomplishment at Le Bernardin, where each year, 150,000 plates are sent from the kitchen to the table.

A Return to Cooking is the antidote. A four-part journey to four different locations over four seasons, the goal of the book was to &ldquo;cook the landscape&rdquo; and &ldquo;cook from the gut,&rdquo; using local, in-season ingredients and experiencing the joys&mdash;and occasional disappointments&mdash;of the spontaneity and creativity that are at the heart of cooking.<br />\r\nRipert often says that much of the best cooking happens at home with family or friends. And so he set off with a group of five friends to do just that. The group not only shopped, cooked, and cleaned up together&mdash;they lived together in four different houses, each of which had a perfectly ordinary kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ripert cooked. Colombian artist Valentino Cortazar sketched and painted. Tammar and Shimon Rothstein photographed. Award-winning author Michael Ruhlman captured the creative process in prose. And Andrea Glick, Ripert&rsquo;s right hand, ensured the recipes ended up on paper so they could be tested and perfected later. Everyone partook, and everyone&mdash;especially Ripert&mdash;learned along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This eminently practical book, with nearly 150 recipes, is also a teaching book; dozens of short essays offer advice on subjects like the handling of raw fish, the power of the vinaigrette, and even the merits of Tabasco, shallots, and lemon confit. And of course, it offers guidance about roasting, seasoning, poaching, and saut&eacute;ing. Every bit as fascinating is the book&rsquo;s bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the magic that is created when decades of cooking experience, the forces of intuition, the music of the season, and the ingredients of the landscape all coalesce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$50</p>\r\n","blurb2":"","buttonLink1":"","pageTitle":"Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert | A Return To Cooking","buttonSwitch1":"","buttonText1":"","h1":"A Return To Cooking","h2":"50","h3":"4","h4":"4","showinNav":1,"checkbox1":0,"sortOrder":6,"image1_anchor":"","parentID":71,"linkTitle":"A Return To Cooking","template":"product","image1":"","id":78},{"blurb1":"<p><em>by Maguy LeCoze and Eric Ripert (Broadway Books, 1998)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Co-owner Maguy Le Coze traces the roots of Le Bernardin&rsquo;s culinary &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; to her late brother, Gilbert, the restaurant&rsquo;s legendary co-founder and first chef: &ldquo;Gilbert was not a classically trained chef,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He had never been to culinary school. When he cooked, he made things he liked, and things he knew. He focused on the quality and freshness of the fish. He made nages and vinaigrettes because he&rsquo;d never made a hollandaise or a b&eacute;arnaise. He focused on flavors that were delicate, subtle, herb-infused.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Chef Eric Ripert carries on the tradition with simple but nuanced dishes such as Poached Halibut on Marinated Vegetables, Pan-Roasted Grouper with Wild Mushrooms and Artichokes, and Grilled Salmon with Mushroom Vinaigrette.
