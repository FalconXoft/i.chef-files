The store is owned by an elderly couple and I believe they run it on their own. We got take out. We shared the chicken curry puff , amazing with the cucumber sauce! I got the chicken drunken noodles and it was actually one of the best I’ve had so far (even compared with the city), yes it’s mildly spicy but I love spicy so it had a nice kick and i was happy that it was so flavorful and not heavy!  Pat had the massaman curry and peanut noodles, also delicious! All meals were fresh  and made me feel like this is how they would cook at home.

I was worried about going with young kids who are picky eaters (9 and 7)  The food looked and tasted amazing, the vibe was relaxed and welcoming, and everyone was super friendly. It’s also really kid-friendly — our kids can be tough to please, but they were obsessed. The server even gave them kid chopsticks, which they thought was the coolest thing ever.\n\nThe food was awesome all around:\n\n•Yakitori– tender with a really good sauce. You could tell it was fresh.\n\n•Teriyaki chicken– soft, flavorful, and the rice was perfect.\n\n•Gyoza – veggie dumplings with great texture.\n\n•Maki rolls– California and shrimp tempura rolls were both hits. We also tried the salmon avocado and cucumber avocado!\n\n•Yuzu dessert– light, fluffy, and just the right hint of lemon and blueberry. I was really impressed with the flavor and texture and wished the slice was a bit bigger it was so good. We don’t usually eat dessert so that’s saying something.\n\n•Matcha pudding-  not our thing, but if you’re into matcha, and not so sweet dessert you’ll love it.\n\nWe’d 100% come back. The kids were already telling our waitress that next time we’re in NYC, **this is the first place we’re going**. Couldn’t have asked for a better dinner with my boys.",

The calamari was slightly overcooked so it was a little bit chewy, but it was well-seasoned and crispy, so still enjoyable. The vongole pasta was also an overcooked, but the clam flavor came through nicely, making it tasty overall. The pork chop was again slightly overcooked, but not dry, and the side dishes, spinach and mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned and well-prepared, making the whole dish satisfying.

    "text": "Garden Cafe gets points for being in the right place at the right time, but beyond that, it was pretty mediocre. My top tier chum who literally went to the school of hospitality and I came here for a strategic lunch/rest this past Saturday during the Great Saunter (an annual event I would heartily recommend to anyone physically and mentally able - five stars all around). After not finishing the Saunter last year, I decided at the very least it was important to get off our feet for a bit, and this location made a lot of sense, literally a few buildings away from the official route off Isham Street very close to the halfway point of our adventures. Given how we were feeling at the time, this was definitely within a quarter mile of where we needed it to be before people started getting VERY yowly.\n\nThis area of Inwood is really pleasant; I've been over here now a few times and it's super underrated because most people never bother to wander up past the GW Bridge. But it's super chill and gives off some Brooklyn vibes. And optics-wise, Garden Cafe fits right in. True to its name, it has a great outdoor seating area in the back, which was the perfect antidote on a pleasant day with sore feet. The interior though is dimly lit and very claustrophobic; each time we went through (entering and exiting), we had to wait for other people to pass in the area by the restroom/awkward bar area. I'm not sure how you improve that situation without a full-on reno, but it's not the best. The outdoor space helps for sure in that regard.\n\nWe needed carbs like the wolf with 16 miles to go on our trek. I went with the strawberry pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and a vanilla latte (mostly so my chum and I would remain on speaking terms after only having a fraction of my normal coffee intake at the beginning of the day). Everything was fine though nothing to write home about. The pancakes were a little dry and definitely needed the accompanying syrup, and the eggs conversely were wetter than I typically like. They also needed a bit of seasoning but they did what they were supposed to do. In hindsight, the latte might have actually been the best of the lot - it had a visually pleasing design from the milk pour and was tasty. Most of the patrons we saw nearby were on mimosa benders, which sounded fun but we had a job to do. Next time.\n\nThis place got a lot of points off for the service. Our waitress was not particularly friendly - very monotone and never smiled, and once our food came? A ghost. We rarely even saw her in the patio area and we probably ended up staying an extra 15 minutes because we literally just couldn't find her to get the check. Really odd unforced error and it was actually close to the point where one of us was going to have to go inside to actively find her to ask for the bill. Not good at all.\n\nIt wasn't a terrible meal by any stretch and I think ultimately you give it a thumbs up for providing a spot to rest and eat, but most people would probably consider that the bare minimum requirement of a restaurant. I'm sure you can find better around here.",

I ordered steak/shrimp fajitas (choose up to 3 proteins) and the portion was huge but came with only 2 tortillas??  I asked for more, they charged me $1 for 2 more which is fine I guess but it still wasn't enough tortillas for the amount of fajitas.   My margarita was very good and the atmosphere was great",

Their service is a little slower because of the time it gakes to make their masterpieces. The service is not their strong point, but I assure u that the food highly makes up for it and is well worth the wait. Please disregard the service as they are totally family run and they do their best to serve you. Trust me, when u eat, it will be well worth it.

The space feels polished yet approachable, and other reviewers have noted how it shines for group dining and upscale gatherings.  ￼\n\nHere’s how our meal went:\n\nStarters\n•\tGrilled octopus: Cooked well and crisp at the edges, but I felt it could have used more seasoning to truly stand out.\n•\tHummus: Creamy, smooth, and flavorful—a strong start that I enjoyed.\n\nMain Course\n•\tBeef shishlik: Tender and well executed in terms of cooking technique; however, it lacked a bit of seasoning punch. I’d rate it about 3.5 out of 5—good, but left a little room for improvement.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed ourselves. With the strong service, atmosphere, and overall experience, I’ll definitely be returning to try more dishes. If you’re planning a lunch with friends or colleagues and want somewhere that balances style and comfort—this is a solid choice.",

We got the trio dip and calamari to start, both of which disappeared instantly, and I got the chicken as my main, which blew me away with its depth of flavor despite being a very simple dish.

The half chicken dinner was a pleasant surprise—moist and flavorful, and it’s the first time I’ve seen it offered at a Vietnamese restaurant. The beef and spring roll vermicelli was spot on, with the beef having a jerky-like texture that made the dish even better. The Pho was comforting and well-balanced.\n\nOne thing that stood out was the fish sauce served with the dishes—it had a unique twist. It wasn’t the usual sweet variety, and while I couldn’t quite figure out the ingredients (maybe apple cider vinegar?), it was delicious.\n\nIf you’re craving authentic and flavorful Vietnamese food, Saigon Spring is a must-visit.

    "text": "My wife had an amazing meal here a couple of months ago and has been wanting to bring me since. Schenectady has no shortage of amazing Italian restaurants so the bar was set pretty high.\n\nThe impression you get when you walk in is that not much has changed since the 1960s! The small bar is easily imagined with old friends and cigarette smoke after all hard days work. The restaurant is fairly small and it was crowded and somewhat noisy but that is certainly understandable on a Saturday night. We were seated in about 15 minutes having made a reservation.\n\nThe service was great even though they were obviously overwhelmed. The menu was full of southern and Northern Italian dishes, including things like a red, roasted pepper and provolone appetizer. You don’t see that on many menus. We were probably presented with a basket of bread which tasted like it came from Perreca’s. There was butter and no dipping oil. There is a lovely cocktail selection each very unusual and two of us went for the.Revello, which is blood, orange gin, Cointreau, orange juice, and club soda. It was great, even though a bit strong for my taste.  The salad was served family style, which was a lovely touch. Amazingly fresh with lettuce, tomato, celery, black olives, and small cubes of provolone. Served with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing wonderful.\n\nThe first issue is that our entrées came out too soon. It’s an unusual complaint but when you are enjoying a salad like that and may want to have seconds out of the big bowl, it’s nice to have a little bit of time. That being said as busy as it was, I’m not sure they had the luxury of optimal timing.\n\nAs for entrées, one of us had chicken francese, reported as being wonderful. The eggplant Parmesan, likewise, and it was lightly fried or sautéed, and did not have a breading on it. I should report that the portions are very large. I had the seafood platter, which is more like a.zuppa de pesce, which I had in red sauce, but you can have in white sauce as well, which contained a huge amount of clams shrimp calamari scallops. The shrimp were large 16/20 or possibly larger.\n\nThe one food issue of the night is the haddock piccata. When my wife first ate here, she found this dish to be amazing and brought some home and I agreed. What made it amazing is it had a very light coating and was sautéed. The coding seemed like just egg and flour. The haddock piccata we had last night was deep fried with a thick breading. It totally took away from the dish, and the breading prevented the sauce from mixing with the fish. I’m not sure if it’s a difference between chefs, but if they read this, I hope they go back to the prior preparation. We did not try the homemade pasta, but it is available as an up charge.\n\nWe left full and happy and will be back. We were in no shape for dessert although I’m sure it is amazing.",

Somethings remain the same; on street parking is hit or miss – this time the parking deity shined upon us with a spot near their front door – with the one person entrance step into their small yet comfortable bar. The bar is the dining room entrance. Ferrari’s dining room was nicely updated and well lighted. All their tables filled quickly.\n\nOur ample broccoli rabe appetizer had the perfect balance of olive oil and garlic that was cooked to tender perfection. A bottle of il Principe Nebbiolo was the ideal wine for our entire meal. It was smooth and flavorful, quite frankly it slid down way too fast.\nA sizable eggplant parmigiano, with an equally huge spaghetti side, was tender, flavorful and perfectly breaded and prepared. My linguini with clam sauce took a while to decipher on their menu. The preferred white clam sauce was one of several offered. When presented it was spot on. A mound of al dente, linguini with tender, sliced garlic and a dozen clams in their shells. The clams were sumptuous, quickly shelled and mixed into the linguini.\n\nA tartufo, presented with a sizable soup spoon, was cracked and enjoyed by all.\n\nOur leftovers, substantial, were enjoyed the next few nights.\nIt was comforting to know that Ferrari’s maintained its high standards and service.",

    "text": "Outstanding Catering Experience – Thank You, Little Italy Canton!\n\nWe recently celebrated our daughter’s high school graduation this past June, and we had the pleasure of having Little Italy Canton cater the event. From start to finish, the entire experience was exceptional.\n\nWe began planning back in December with Jessica and her incredible team. From the very first meeting, Jessica took the time to walk us through each dish, offering thoughtful suggestions on what would work best for our event. Her knowledge and professionalism were immediately evident, and we felt confident we were in great hands.\n\nThe food was a hit! We started off with a “Wing Bar” for appetizers, followed by a delicious main course spread, and later in the evening, ten pizzas were brought out for a late-night snack—which turned out to be a huge success with our guests! Every dish was exactly as promised—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented.\n\nJessica’s attention to detail was beyond reproach. Her team arrived on time, helped with setup, and ensured everything ran smoothly. What stood out most was the consistency—her original quote from our first meeting stayed the same right through to the day of the party, with no hidden fees or last-minute surprises.\n\nWe received so many compliments from our guests about the food and the overall presentation. Without a doubt, Little Italy Canton played a big role in making our celebration memorable.\n\nThank you, Jessica and your amazing staff—you did a fantastic job, and we truly appreciate it!",

I just want anybody that comes here to BEWARE of the hidden fees and EXTRA CHARGES. The first one is for $3.50 for some kind of OPEN FOOD TAX, never heard of it.  The second, is if you pay with credit, I understand most establishment charges for using credit, but nowhere on the menu or walking in the door did they tell you there was a charge for using a credit card. After getting my receipt I was charged over $6 for using a credit card, when it was questioned I was told the prices on the menu WERE credit card prices and yet I was still charged for using a credit card. Just beware of all the hidden charges I paid $11 above and beyond my bill FOR USING A CC CARD. As for the food their garlic knots are the size of golf balls plus paid extra for sauce( don't they normally come with sauce) , portions are VERY small, and do not come with bread or salad, for the price.  We had a child's spaghetti and was charged $4.00 for sauce, PLUS charged for sauce on boneless wings,  BEWARE OF  All THE EXTRA CHARGES.  Typical college town pizza place.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a slice and a cheese steak. The pizza is solid 9 out of 10. I had a reheated slice, I believe that a whole pie fresh out of the oven would rate even higher. I will go back for the pizza without hesitation. If you like traditional thin crust, they have nailed it, crust, sauce cheese all great. Now the reason for the 3 rating. The cheese”steak”., you don’t want to order. Roll solid 8 out of ten. Amount of onions 9.5 out of 10. The onions were pretty big  chunks as opposed to to thinly sliced so that detracted and the sauté on the onions was close but they needed more time. Cheese, non typical mozzarella, not my first choice but worked and the amount was good. Moving onto the “steak”. No seasoning. Amount pitiful. The real challenge was figuring out out exactly what the “steak” was. Unlike any other “meat” I have ever had on a cheese steak. I will go with the assumption that it was beef, hopefully for a bovine, but cheese steak meat it was not. Cheese “steak, overall gets a 3 out of 10. Pizza hell yes, mystery meat cheese steak, hell no.",

Everything was excellent. Jeannie was an excellent server and we all enjoyed talking to her.  We were drinking mimosas (VERY good) and didn't know what they were priced at.  The menu posted in the restroom had them listed at $9 each, but they came up at $10 on the bill.  If you search for the menu online right now, they are listed at $6.  6 vs. 10 is a big difference.

We assumed he was checking for available seating or something. He was actually running food, although sauntering along slowly was more accurate. Meanwhile people came in behind us that told us they were extremely late for their reservation. When the host came back and finally acknowledged us he said he would need to figure out a place to put us. We moved out of the way, and he talked to the people behind us and seated them immediately, even though they were admittedly really late and the policy indicated that the reservation is only held for 15 minutes. We were both two-tops. When we did get seated a few minutes later at a large table, the menus were thrown at us. We then waiting for a full fifteen minutes without anyone even greeting us or taking our drink order. My wife had to flag a server down to get service at all. We told them that we had a show that we needed to get to. Our drinks took another 15 minutes to come out, and our food, even though it was an appetizer, salad and mac and cheese, did not come out for a half hour after ordering. People around us who were seated after us had their food and drinks much sooner. My wife is a long-time server and she was livid at the treatment. Nobody that worked there showed any sense of urgency, and there was no dress code to indicate that someone DID work there. The host wore a graphic T shirt and athletic pants with stripes down the side. We only knew people were servers because at some point they walked by with food. It was a Saturday night- if you don't have the staffing to handle it, don't take reservations and only seat the amount of the people you can take care of and take care of well. Never ever will we return, and absolutely do not recommend. There are PLENTY of other places to eat.",

The other thing was the tables were a little small for all the delicious food we wanted to order lol.\nWe had the Gluten-free Mac n cheese which had an exquisitely creamy cheese sauce with a nice sharpness to it. The Gluten-free fish was crispy and moist inside  (we switched out the fries or rather \"chips\" to  side of coconut rice) which was a nice contrast so that it wasn't a completely fried plate.

    "text": "Among the best dining experiences in Ithaca, Simeons is a classic fine dining experience that executes its dishes to perfection consistently. Their appetizer game is strong, with fresh and delicious choice. Their entrees also always blow me away, and if they have the ribeye, it is truly spectacular here. The prime rib is also amazing; and the sides for any entree I’ve ever had have lived up the entree quality. Even if you do not want any, make sure you ask to see the desserts! They have an awesome presentation and are some of the best single serve desserts I’ve ever had at a restaurant. The key lime pie one is my personal favorite and a must try if you are here. This place is expensive, but worth it, and if I were in Ithaca, i would come here and then walk off my meals in the commons, because it is also in a beautiful area.",

Best decision ever. From the moment we sat down, the staff made us feel like regulars. Everyone was super friendly, professional and clearly passionate about what they do.\n\nThe open kitchen setup is something special, it feels like you’re part of the show. The chef himself came over to chat with us, explained the specials and even served a few dishes directly from the kitchen to the bar. You can see and taste the creativity and care that goes into every plate.\n\nWe had several small plates, each one beautifully presented and full of flavor. The fig salad was refreshing and perfectly balanced, the meat skewer was juicy and smoky, and the short rib absolutely unreal, melt- n your mouth good. Every dish looked like a piece of art.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy, elegant and energetic the kind of spot where you lose track of time and just enjoy great food, drinks, and conversation.\n\nMust-try: The short rib and the chef’s seasonal specials.\nPro tip: Sit at the bar if you can — you’ll get the full SHMONÉ experience.\n\nA memorable dining experience from start to finish. Can’t wait to come back!",

We walked in early, thinking we’d just grab a quick dinner… and then four hours later, we were still sitting at the bar, eating, laughing, drinking, and watching this wild kitchen ballet happening right in front of us.\n\n🔥 We had front-row seats — chefs flying, pans sizzling, olive oil dripping like gold. You could feel the energy. Everyone’s working hard but smiling, throwing jokes around, pouring martinis, and making it all look effortless.\n\n🥯 We started with that famous Jerusalem bagel — warm, fluffy, olive oil and za’atar dripping off the edges — honestly, I could’ve stopped right there and called it a night. But then came the tuna, so fresh it practically winked at us, and the octopus, smoky and soft with those beans… unreal.\n\n😋 The sweetbreads hit the table next — I don’t even know how to explain it — crispy, tangy, creamy, somehow a salad but not really a salad. The pistachio pesto pasta was so good we stopped talking for five minutes.\n\n🥩 And then the 76-layer Wagyu. Oh my God. The waiter brought us challah after and said, “you’ll need this to soak up the juice,” and he was absolutely right — we cleaned that plate like it was the last supper.\n\n🍷 Between bites and martinis, we kept saying, “just one more dish,” but we didn’t want to leave. Everything was shareable, everything was perfect, and every bite was better than the last.\n\nMust-haves: 🥩 Beef short rib ❤️ Sweetbreads 🐙 Octopus 🐟 Tuna 🥯 Jerusalem bagel\n\nIf I could move in and sit at that bar every night, I would. This isn’t just dinner — it’s a whole New York moment. SHMONÉ, you got me. I’m hooked.",

Honestly, the variety of duck options here is like I have never seen before and we have two duck aficionados in the family.\n\nThere were also green curry, obligatory papaya salad and tom yum. With all that, the most memorable selection among us carnivores was a vegetarian entree called Eggplant’s Garden — the texture and mildly spicy sweet sauce are not to be missed.\n\nOur carefully boxed leftovers lasted two more lunches.",

I was looking for a sophisticated but reasonable happy hour venue with my husband and found this lovely place that has recently opened in our neighborhood. During the day they are a charming coffee shop and in the early evening they convert to a wine bar with delicious Georgian appetizers and entrees. Standouts are the traditional Khachapuri cheese bread, Boquerones en Vinagre with Oven-baked Potatoes (marinated anchovies with potatoes), and a lovely selection of organic and natural low impact wines from Georgia, Moravian wine from the Czech Republic as well as  wines from more familiar regions including France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and the US. The food photos are a little haphazard, as we were voraciously eating our food before remembering to take pictures first, but hopefully they accurately represent the fare. Of note, the entire kitchen is behind the bar so you can watch the food alchemy that is occurring right before your eyes by the experienced and congenial team. We will definitely be back to enjoy their dinner menu for my birthday - if not before!",

I thought that their duck scallion pancake was great, but could use just a bit for sauce. Meanwhile, their pan-fried dumplings were delicious, full of meat, and juicy.

Packed with people from everywhere. It is busy so expect a line outside and inside. If you want full service with almost no wait, walk to the back. But half the fun is joining the organized chaos and doing it the classic way.\n\nMy server was amazing. He let me taste different meats before deciding and that small gesture made my day. I tipped him twenty dollars because he deserved it and he genuinely appreciated it.\n\nThe pastrami and corned beef are next level. The pastrami is the star for me. Juicy and full of flavor. If you prefer something a bit less spiced, go for the corned beef. You cannot go wrong with either. It was so crowded that there were no open seats so we invited a couple of strangers to join our table. Ended up having a great time. People from all over the country and the world all enjoying the same beautiful meal.\n\nThe coleslaw was fresh and delicious. The fries were solid and hit the spot. The portions are generous and the value is incredible. There is a reason they have tens of thousands of reviews.\n\nIf you are in New York, Katz’s is a must. The food is fantastic and the experience is unforgettable. It is truly a unique place.",

    "text": "I really wanted to LOVE the pastrami sandwich; but I didn’t, it was just ok. Probably wouldn’t pay $28.95 again for a sandwich. Also, even if you are not sitting down for waiter-service, you have to tip a few dollars to EACH station (cutters, sides & drinks) - now that is a $35-40 sandwich.\n\nHighlights are the fast service each respective station (cutters and sides/drinks). The line from around the block to inside moved reasonably quick and all-in-all, perhaps a 25-30min wait on a Saturday evening.\n\nThe pastrami sandwich itself….maybe I’m just not a fan of deli-style pastrami cuts, but it just seemed dry versus a BBQ-style pastrami.\n\nSeating was first come-first served; and staff won’t really go out of their way to clean up unless you depart and they get around to it. There is a section of seating all the way back that has servers, but we seat in General dining area and shared a 4-seat table with others for a short period.",

    "text": "Pastrami with cheese with no sauce on bread with a side of coleslaw is the only thing one should order here 😁. Great pastrami sandwich and coleslaw goes well with it.\n\nEach individual must get a ticket at entrance no matter eating or not!, If ordering meat then get in any one of the ~10 lines and order your food which they make in front of you, that alone is worth 5 star to me :). Then customize right there with cheese or which spread and that is it. The cook is gonna mark your ticket before you get the food. Then go to another place for order drinks and cole slaw etc and they will mark on your ticket. Then go find a table and get in. The way they are letting people in , you will for sure get a chair but might have to share a table with a stranger, heck it's NYC so why not. I got a movie recommendation for Sisu 2 !!!.. now if you want more then get back in line and order and get your ticket marked again. Keep goin until you need to leave where you checkout and must present your ticket to get out after paying the dues cash in one corner and credit in the other corner of restaurant, heck it's NYC so you know.. forgot your ticket? Well if not ticket then pay at the least 50 bucks and some rough housing perhaps before you are let out. All in all definitely worth the expensive cost. Its a manhattan experience better then summit it WTC IMO! On the way out back to subway get your El churros with dulce caramel dip sauce from \"El churros\" and that is a nice Dinner experience all together! Have fun",

    "text": "Oh my goodness. We ordered one Pastrami, one Corned Beef, and of course  the assorted pickles. Perfect. Expensive, at almost $30/sandwich, so definitely more of a luxury sandwich, but worth it. The meat was so tender and juicy, the mustard sauce was great (a little more spice would have made it perfect), and we were able to get a good seat to eat our food. There wasn’t much direction from the staff…. They gave general instructions and we had to figure out quite a bit…. What to do with the tickets, where to stand for the lines (they were more groups of people than actual lines), where to pay (we thought up front, until we got there, waited, but then learned that was cash only and cards payments were in the back of the restaurant). Same with the tickets.. the cutters put both orders on one ticket, and we used that one to pay, so we had no idea that the other was needed to exit. Had to empty our bag off to the side to retrieve it from the bottom. All in all, a delicious, though not seamless experience. Will return ready to navigate this deli adventure.",

I ordered the legendary pastrami sandwich, a matzo ball soup and a side of half sour pickles and every bite felt like stepping back into New York’s golden era.\nThe pastrami is juicy, smoky, perfectly spiced and piled sky high between slices of fresh rye bread. The soup is comforting, with a fluffy matzo ball that melts into the rich broth.\n\nYes, it’s busy but that’s part of the magic. Watching the carvers hand slice steaming pastrami behind the counter while neon lights glow and the crowd buzzes with energy is an unforgettable NYC experience.\n\nI finished everything to the last bite worth every penny and every minute in line. Katz’s isn’t just food it’s a New York institution since 1888.\n\nMust try: Pastrami on rye with mustard, matzo ball soup and pickles.\nTip: Keep your yellow ticket safe, find a seat after ordering, and just enjoy the show.\n\nUpdate: The team was super kind to reply! I’ll be back for another sandwich next time for sure… 🍞💛",

My wife and I had been there once before and convinced my mother, a native Ecuadorian, to come try the food. We ordered the grilled octopus and bolon mixto as appetizers. Both were really great. My sister and I I enjoyed a drink similar to a margarita (forgot the name), which was also good. As an entree, my wife ordered the enecebollado de pescado (fish soup made of tuna), which she loved. I tried it and loved it too. It was filling and she brought home the leftovers. I had la bandera, which was good, but not mind blowing. The rice was great; but I thought the goat was mostly bones. I had substituted the tripe for hen, and thought that was mostly bones too. The ceviche was REALLY good. For dessert, we ordered the flan and chocolate mousse. The flan was very bland, but the chocolate mousse was great. I honestly wish I had tried the caldo de bola. We had ordered it the first time and I loved it so much. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! The service is great here and they let you dance salsa :) We’ll be back!",

I’m on a bit of a review kick so it was unlikely I would have returned any time soon. The ninja turtle was really good, I loved how chewy the crust was and the pizza was quite cheesy how I liked. All the toppings were quite hearty and it  was filling. I would have liked it a little less floppy but I know that would have been quite hard with all the toppings on it. Flavor was quite good so yes I would definitely eat it again. Most of all I appreciate an owner willing to take criticism and eager to correct it and not brush it off. He clearly cares about his product and customers. Please give the pizza a try when you’re in the neighborhood!\n\nSo I ordered takeout online and the regular pie was not an option so I got square. They told me 5 more min, I stepped out and came back and it was another 5 more min. Fairly slow and pizza was not good but I don’t really like square. I just wanted to prepay and get out. I would go back to try a regular slice but my first experience annoyed me so I won’t be back soon.",

Later, when our pasta dishes arrived, I requested additional bread for the table. The same gentleman (I use that term loosely)visibly grimaced and replied, “I already brought you bread.” I clarified i am aware we wanted more, to which he responded, “I’ll bring you more bread, but I’m going to charge you.”\nThis exchange felt unnecessarily dismissive and unprofessional. While I understand there may be policies regarding additional items, the tone and manner in which this was communicated did not align with the warm and welcoming service I expected from your establishment.",

While it’s not necessarily the kind of place for a long sit-down meal, its location makes it perfect for a quick pickup before heading to one of the many nearby parks.\n\nI tried the spicy poke dish and was genuinely impressed by the freshness of the ingredients. The fish and vegetables tasted like they had been prepped to order, and you can tell the team puts care into the quality of what they serve. That said, the vegetables in the poke were fairly plain—I personally would have enjoyed some pickled or marinated elements to add variety and balance to the bowl. The portion of fish wasn’t overly generous, but they were not shy with the sauces, which added a flavorful kick without overpowering the dish.\n\nService-wise, they’ve always been reliable and on time with pickup orders. On my visits, they’ve been warm and grateful, especially noticing and appreciating repeat customers—which is rare and always a nice touch in a busy city.\n\nOverall, West Side Wok is a solid neighborhood option when you’re craving fresh poke or sushi on the go. It’s convenient, friendly, and consistent—a dependable spot for a casual meal, especially if you’re planning to enjoy it outdoors.",

So, we finally decided to take the 1 hour trip and try it out for our date night.\nStaff was helpful, warm, and friendly. They answered all our questions and made sure we felt confident about everything. Restaurant itself was clean and inviting, the bathrooms were kept up and everything was good.\n\nWe ordered the goulash, jagershnitzel, sviekova, a Czech beer, and fruit pudding for dessert. Unfortunately, both of us got pretty sick by the next morning. I'm not sure if it's just the cuisine itself since we'd never had it before and maybe it was heavy on our system or if something maybe wasn't cooked properly and we didn't catch it since we're not familiar with the dishes. I don't want to point any fingers, because we truelly don't know but this ended up not being a fun experience. I tried calling the restaurant to just let them know, but the line goes to voicemail. We're still recovering from our visit, I personally haven't been able to leave the house because it's been that bad. Not really the experience we were aiming for.",

Nonetheless I had a great time, as I love experiencing cuisines that I've never been exposed to, and this time, it was Czech food. We were a party of 7, all carnivores except for me, all drinkers except for me and my husband, and one of them is a beer connoisseur, so I learned that Pilsner, a pale lager, is the most famous Czech beer. The only option on the menu for me was a selection of salads, and I opted for one of my favorite vegetables - beetroot. Their servings are quite generous, and according to my fellow diners, the taste was impeccable. They ordered a lot of beer, and together we ordered a lot of food - salads, appetizers, mains, breads, and desserts. It's a large space, its walls covered with photos and objects of antiquity. One can definitely go around like in a museum and learn a bit about the history of Czech immigrants in New York City. If you love hearty meat dishes, exotic flavors and great beer, this place is definitely for you!",

So, dining hear again was a no brainer.. Del Frisco's it is.\n\nOur second time didn't disappoint either We ordered steaks, cocktails, appetizers and wine.\n\nFor the cocktails, she had the Passion Fruit Margarita, and I had the Whistle Pig Barrel Aged Manhattan. The cocktails were on point. Additionally, we both had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon with our meal.\n\nFor the appetizer we went with the Thick-Cut Nueske’s Bacon and the Charred Octopus. The Bacon was excellent, smokey and delicious. The Octopus was disappointing.  It was overcooked and chewy, so we had to send that one back.\n\nFor our main courses, my wife ordered the Braised Angus Short Rib and was  later informed  that it was sold out, so she settled for the Filet Mignon, and I had the Bone-In Prime Ribeye.  For our sides we had fries, broccolini and the Classic Caesar. Oh, and not to mention, that wonderful warm bread for the table. All of the meats were cooked to perfection, the sides were great, but on a side note... the side of fries was way more then we expected. I would say was enough for 5 people.\n\nThe steak house itself has a nice sexy ambiance, but still chill enough for the fellas to grab a meal or hang at the bar.\n\nThe service was great, our waiter M.D. was very professional and attentive. He was very apologetic for the mess up on the Short Rib order and the over cooked Octopus. Even the Supervisor,  (Kristin), came over and checked on us to make sure we were good and chatted with us about the New York food scene.\n\nThank you both for a good time.",

I visited for my birthday at the recommendation of my partner’s brother, and the evening was exceptional from start to finish.\n\nThe centerpiece of our meal was a 34-ounce porterhouse, perfectly cooked to a medium-rare that balanced a charred exterior with a tender, juicy interior. The steak delivered exactly what one expects from a top-tier steakhouse, both in flavor and execution. Accompanying sides often risk being an afterthought, but here the mashed potatoes were a highlight in their own right, rich, buttery, and layered with garlic that enhanced rather than overwhelmed.\n\nFor dessert, the kitchen presented a celebratory dish that closed the meal on a high note, a thoughtful and indulgent finish to an already memorable evening.\n\nDel Frisco’s succeeds in maintaining an atmosphere that feels both refined and celebratory, making it an excellent choice for special occasions.

They’re unlike any I’ve had elsewhere—perfectly seared, packed with fresh crab, and elevated with a subtle touch of Indian masala that adds just the right amount of warmth and depth without overpowering the delicate seafood. It’s a unique twist that sets them apart from the typical steakhouse appetizer.\n\nOn top of the excellent food, the service is always impeccable.

Upon receiving the steak it came overcooked. We ordered medium and it was more like well done. They quickly replaced the dish, even took away our side dishes to ensure we can enjoy the sides hot with our replacement steak.\n\nThe replacement quickly came as they happened to have another order of the same temperature and gave us that one instead. To my disappointment, the bone is quite small and they also wet-age their steak, which I find less flavorful.  Both the corn and the mushrooms were good, however, I find their portions are on the smaller side. With the same number of dishes ordered from my favorite steakhouse, I'd be leaving feeling fairly full and satisfied. It wasn't the case at Del Frisco's. Granted, we usually order a mashed potatoes instead but I wanted to try their corn.\n\nOverall, it was a nice dining experience. The service was good and the environment was nice.",

The peppers added a level of spice to the usual bread table starters. Calamari and herbed potato wedges were nice for starters. The main course - I went with the homemade black gnocchi with lobster tail, and was lip smashingly delicious to the last bite. Post lunch espresso was served at the right temperature - not scathing hot. Thoroughly recommend!",

The cocktails are top-tier, and the food easily outperforms what most music venues even attempt. My crab cakes were crisp perfection, the salad was fresh, and the service stayed calm even with a packed house.\n\nNow for the part that ruined the vibe. The mandatory entrée rule. I came for drinks and small plates, happily spent several times the cost of an entrée, and was still told I had to order one or leave it uneaten. It felt like a cheap money grab at a place that otherwise screams class. Nothing kills the mood faster than being told your perfectly good dinner order isn’t “enough.”\n\nI still respect the music and the kitchen, both are excellent, but that policy left a bad taste I can’t ignore.\n\nThree stars.

It was a cold night and the ACs were on high and we (and the folks at the neighboring table) were FREEZING. Had to wear coat throughout show and still cold. The ACs were blowing right on us and not only that - you could actually HEAR the air blowing which interfered with the experience of enjoying a solo piano concert. We mentioned it to the waiter and the manager and nothing was done. The room was only 1/3 full and it was cold out: why would they not take this into consideration and turn down the AC's? Given the high cost of their food and the tickets, plus requiring that you order 2 entrees (1 $68 steak +1 appetizer is not enough for them), we felt ripped off and upset and will probably not come back for a long time. Plus my partner's food came out lukewarm. With high prices like this they should be much more customer-oriented. It's too bad because we've had so many great musical experiences at Smoke.",

Once I said how many, I looked at the tables and saw that it was basically full and expected to have some wait time or get changed to outdoor seating. Instead I was happily surprised the server was just looking at the tables to see which ones they would be able to separate for me. I personally ordered a S&S roll and a bottle of ‘CHOKARA delicious and fruity’ for the table. The drink and the sides were the first thing we received with our first round poured for us in soju cups.i don’t typically like the taste of alcohol but this one was easy to bear and we were able to finish the whole bottle with our meal leaving one last toast at the end. Though the service was friendly and attentive our final toast was a bit ruined for me as the server lightly tossed the check presenter at the table which caused my glass to spill. The server immediately walked away as their job was done but with no napkins left(as we only had one for each person) a little mess was unfortunately left.\nI recommend anyone have my order but especially try the miso soup as it was very easy, deliciously simple and the perfect temperature that lasted our foods wait time.",

This place used to be amazing.... unfortunately now that they have the clientele they are cutting corners or worse....\nI ordered soft crab, when the plate came there were 2 pieces of crab. Confused i asked if it was suppose to be the whole crab, the server decided to count the pieces. She must have thought i was blind, as she started counting fried yam and mushroom as the crab. I said that was incorrect and opened in half the yam and mushroom. She brought a new plate, when i requested for the crab not to be cut she said the chef had already diced it. Red flag number one. I also ordered chirashi. When asked what was the difference between it and the delux, i was told sea urchin and salmon fish. For about 5$ more i decided on the delux. Now about this plate, the fish looked sketchy and i decided to smell the uni, boy o boy! The smell alone would put someone in ER! i asked the server if she could smell the uni, she said thats how it was suppose to smell, however her face and nose betrayed her. As she walked to the chef, he said the whole box smelled the same ...red flag number two. He asked me if I wanted him to open a new box.This told me all i needed to hear. I am not here to tell you to have integrity on what you serve, but if you are willing to poison me i will take my money to an establishment that takes a bit more pride in what they serve.

Solid reviews and really deserves more than a 4.3 rating..come on folks, hype up your favorite spots… because this place a strong and steady flow of local New Yorkers for breakfast (especially families with young kids).\nMy breakfast sandwich, The Modern, was delicious! I was able to change the ciabatta bread to the brioche bun which was soft and sweet and the tomato bacon jam was out of this world, yummy. I’ll definitely add bacon to this sandwich next time. My partner got the steak and eggs, good sized steak, well seasoned, cooked to the desired temperature and the eggs they use here are huge and hearty! We don’t usually like shredded hash browns ( prefer breakfast potatoes) but their hash browns are pretty good with onions and peppers and again, well seasoned.\nAtmosphere is very nice, small but not cramped, clean, and the staff are wonderful; friendly and attentive without being overbearing and they seem to work well as a team to serve all customers. Overall this was a really great experience, slight dings for the fact that the coffee was pretty weak (and o don’t like strong coffee so that’s saying something), and the orange juice was a bit tart/bitter. But that aside we enjoyed it so much we ordered a salad and Cuban sandwich to-go for lunch later!\nAwesome food, great service… stop by!!",

You can never go wrong coming to Taralluci UWS whether it’s for a brunch with friends, a quick stop for a cappuccino or spritz, or a phenomenal spread of apps and entrees for dinner. My favorites are definitely the orichetti and the lamb skewers that were just recently added to the menu, amazing! Oscar is truly incredible and makes the atmosphere very welcoming. He is so attentive and makes some of the best spritzes I’ve had in the city!! Highly recommend this restaurant and will continue coming back :))",

    "text": "Had made reservations for NYE which had a Prix Fixe menu with a decent split of vegetarian and meat selection across three courses. We went for the early seating and it was relatively quiet on a rainy last day of the year.\n\nAlex, our server, was friendly and was kind enough to offer us a glass of wine on the house, after he felt bad having charged full price for our little one on the Prix Fixe menu.\n\nFood overall was pretty decent. There was a Pappardelle pasta for our little one, and a few great options for meat lovers, including a Rib-eye steak which unfortunately lacked flavor, in spite of adding their rather heavy garlic and heavy cream sauce. The lobster tail was thoroughly enjoyed by the seafood lover on our table, and was enough to knock a person out on the table next to us, who possibly had a shell fish allergy. We were glad to see the person doing fine though, towards the end of the meal. Definitely not a nice way to end the year!\n\nNoise levels were on the average end throughout our time there, and their menu and service were pretty good, definitely on the expensive end though. Will definitely visit again sometime in the near future!",

Lol. Batata has a really great variety of options, from the Impossible Burger, Soups, Wraps and more. I have tried a wide variety of these options and they are all fresh and delicious! They have all been seasoned nicely, not too heavy a hand, as sometimes you get with Vegan meals.\n\nGreat food and great service. The menu is stacked with so many delicious options.\n\nMoreover, the Staff are all friendly and greet with smiles and warm welcomes. They all seem to enjoy working at Batata and it shows. The restuarant is always clean and they take pride on their appearance with clean glass and nice decorations.\n\nThe store is conveniently located on a 25A/Ft Salonga Road with plenty of parking. If you choose to dine in you'll always have a seat as they offer indoor and outdoor dining options. They also offer wine in a can which is interesting. They offer various discounts so ask and you can accumulate points towards future meals if you order online with the Toast App.\n\nRegardless of meal time or food preferences, Batata is always worth a visit - Go and enjoy a great meal experience!\n\n*Bonus tip: In Batata's \"Cold Case\" you will find round containers with homemade \"Bites\". (see picture) There are 2 varieties, I only half-jokingly call these my \"crack\" ...:) Literally addicted...make sure to try these too!",

The mix of Asian and Japanese flavours will blow your tastebuds away to heaven. One of my favourite dishes of the night was the foie gras. The duck liver will melt in your mouth, flavours unstoppably seeping in. It was then combined with outstanding rice and bean curd skin, it fits perfectly. The fusion of taste don’t just add up to each other, they multiply each other and increase the already amazing tastiness. It was so good we had to order another plate. Next came the pork knuckles. We ordered both flavours, the vinegar and the garlic. Both were remarkable, but the garlic one was truly  magnificent. Considering I’m not a huge fan of cilantro, it fitted surprisingly well with the extraordinary texture. The dessert was also exceptional. The cheesecake was a mixture of New York style and Japanese style, a soft crumbly exterior and a gooey interior. It wasn’t too sweet, but hit the spot. This spot is a must try, truly ground breaking. I am amazed and do recommend it for everyone.",

    "text": "Short review- order the goma, kani, wagyu, tonsoku. Nabe/hot pot is alright.\n\nI went here a while with a group.\n\nThe first thing that arrived was probably my favorite bite of the night which was the Goma Hamachi for $20 with baby yellowtail with scallion, seaweed, and sesame sauce which is poured table side. The hamachi was excellent quality being buttery with a soft texture and the nutty sesame sauce (said goma) worked nicely with it. This was excellent and I would recommend it heavily.\n\nAlso very tasty was the Kani Harumaki for $14 with a blend of snow crab, pork, mushroom, and vegetables served with spring roll skin which came with a light soy based dipping sauce. There was a bit of sweetness, a bit of earthiness, and some richness and it all fit well with the crispy skin. This was very good as well and was decently portioned for the price point.\n\nAlso very tasty was the Wagyu Yakiniku Wrap for $18 with BBQ washu beef with lettuce, pickled vegetables, and mayo wrapped in a scallion pancake. This was perhaps a bit messy due to the mayo as well as the sweet sauce especially when paired with the slightly oily pancake but the flavor was excellent. The beef quality was high and it had some sweetness to it but not too much so and the pickled vegetables added a nice crunch.\n\nThe Tonsoku Ponzu for $13 with grilled pork feet with scallion and ponzu sauce is one of their signatures that you can't really find in many other Japanese spots. The dish of course has a lot of collagen so it's rich and fatty but the ponzu helps cut down the richness of the pork. There was also a Japanese hot sauce on the table which helped as well. This was also good though I would recommend more compared to other small plates to share.\n\nThe Kara Age for $9 consisting of Japanese fried chicken with mala mayo was pretty standard outside of the price point being relatively cheaper for the portion size compared to most other places. The chicken was pretty tender though I have had much crispier versions before but I can't complain with the light batter and the amount of chicken given. Though the color was different, the mayo also didn't exactly have any type of mala seasoning either but it still worked with the chicken.\n\nThe Koji Ebi Chili for $20 consisting of shrimp with sweet chili over egg omelette was pretty standard western Japanese/Yoshoku style comfort food. There was plenty of shrimp/ebi in there and the sweet chili was standard. I wish the egg was a bit fluffier but that is only a minor fault in an otherwise standard tasty dish.\n\nLast was our large main to share which was the Tonton Hotpot (or nabe) which is $68 for the large or $38 for the small and we got the large one which was large and fine. This came with pork feet, chicken thigh, pork belly, dumplings, tofu, vegetables, and your choice of soup where we got the spicy miso tonsoku soup. The primary meat in there was the tonsoku/pork feet with there being some thigh and a little bit of dumplings and pork belly. Outside of the size which is easily big enough for four people as it should be for the price point, it's hard not to compare it unfavorably to some other nabe spots such as Kimura or even some other recent ones such the izakaya Toriya on the LES which both had much better broths, a little more variety in terms of vegetables, and was not focused on one meat in particular. Possibly the motsu/intestine pot is better here but I would recommend sticking with their other dishes instead.\n\nThis place is tasty with plenty of highlights and a worthy successor to the original excellent izakaya.",

Lots of ingredients like shrimp, egg and lotus root. Beef tripe with turnip is so refreshing paired up with the chili spicy oil. The tofu wrap is so tasty. Porridge’s absolutely amazing. You can tell it’s freshly cooked and prepared with lots of time. When it comes to the sticky rice dishes, I prefer the pearl one more because it’s softer and with more kinds proteins.

Love the interior and spacious seating and of cause the food carts pushing around the tables for you to choose are much fun and missed, most dim sum restaurants not offer the food carts nowadays, even in Asian countries. Food are delicious generally, we enjoyed a lot on all dim sum dishes. We had brunch on a weekday and thus no wait time. However, the second want to revisit on a weekend lunch time, we had waited almost an hour downstairs outside the elevator and still so crowded. Had to change to another nearby dim sum restaurant after an hour wait. Recommend to go on weekdays or go earlier over weekends and prepare for long wait.",

If you want to just walk-in, it’s better you show up before 11am on Saturday and Sunday. Otherwise you may have to wait up to one hour.\nThey also have a to-go only entrance on the ground floor.",

The peanuts really provides a good crunchiness to the savory curry. Loved how the potato’s absorb the flavors. The pad Thai with shrimp also great, and I asked for a drink that’s not too sweet and the lemon Thai ice tea was just it. Really washes away the curry and refresh the palate for another round of flavor. The lunch special pricing is amazing, would be here on the regular and if not order delivery.",

Fresh fish, fresh fruit, fresh sauce, fresh cream, fresh presentation—insanely delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe tiger bread was some of the most exceptional bread we've ever had as well. The garlic was as buttery smooth to spread as the whipped butter itself, and was pleasantly flavorful without being overly potent.\n\nMy next course was the butternut squash rigatoni. The garnish on top was light and crisp and added that extra accent to the whole dish to round it off beautifully. My wife got the iberico pork, which was cooked to tender perfection. The broccoli mash concoction that came with it was reminiscent of broccoli rabe but basically in it's ultimate form anime-style. Crazy inventive.\n\nThe next course for me was the beer battered monkfish with risotto and was actually the best beer battered anything I've ever tasted. Superior crisp encasing that mouth melting fish. The risotto had crispy chunks in it as well and helped offset the heaviness of the fried fish like a wife offsets her husband's hard shell exterior and gives way to his heart of flesh. Speaking of, my wife got the lamb with risotto and it was yet again a perfectly tender cut of meat. It was smokey and carried a more intense flavor, which also was rounded out by the gentleness of the risotto, complimenting it on that marital level yet again.\n\nLastly, the desserts came in and ended the whole show the same way it began—with favorite-level energy. It was the solid second favorite course for both of us. Mine was the panna cotta. Yo. It went crazy. It was like a salted caramel apple cheesecake, but after finding a way to dial in each ingredient to the max before artistically laying it all out on a plate without any of the cheesecake crust. I LOVE sweet/savory, and it encapsulated that in a dessert beautifully. My wife had the chocolate cake with ice cream, and like we don't even know how to properly describe how good that one was—but here goes nothing. The cake was dark dark and rich rich from the sauce oozing on top to the moist pastry itself. The ice cream had a citrus undertone to it that balanced out the richness of the cake. Literally, yin and yang on a plate with the freshest chocolate drenched cherries on top. Good Lord, the Lord is good indeed.\n\nThe service was top notch, from the warm greetings, to the coat check in, to the menu break down, to the seamless water refilling and course transitions. We are big on omakase type meals as sushi heads, and this was up there while being a fraction of the price. There was a chill and comforting vibe to the whole restaurant as well. Take a trip here and let them take your palette on a trip it will sing praises on the whole way through. Bless.",

This place will provide you with very fine example of Netherland culinary. The place is very classy, yet cozy and perfect for a romantic dinner.

The dessert was equally great, especially passion Fruit- a perfect combination of taste and texture without being too sweet.  The portions on the conservative side, but were very filling and price is also very comfortable for the quality of this place.

The pro is being able to try special wild game that many other places dont have, but also, everything but 1-2 dishes were very average and forgettable.  Overall a fun experience, but not sure if it’s worth the money.\n\nWild boar potstickers - it was good but it just tasted like a pork dumpling, nothing exciting. I would order again if it wasn’t $21 for 4 pieces.\nNew orleans turtle soup - super tasty but again, it kind of just tasted like a tomato soup with some ground beef. some crackers wouldve gone great with it to add some texture as well.\nStuffed quail - texture was perfect, outside was slightly crispy but easy to cut through. the sauce that came with it on the plate was the star. not worth $45 to me personally but defintely something to try at least once.\nVension - absolutely delicious! one of my favorites of the whole meal. our waiter gave us a little fork to get the marrow out of bone and that was the cherry on top. could have ate 3 of these plates. very savory. kind of tasted like beef stew?\nAntelope - my first time trying and I wasnt the biggest fan of the texture but the taste of the antelope with the potato and sauce was delicious. hard to explain what the taste is but at $49, defintely a fun special treat yourself dish.\nElk chops - have never tasted something like this beforr and the herb murturd crust was perfect. 2 chops for $61 but it was definitely worth it. I would order it again and kind of crazy but definitely worth the price in my opinion.\n\nAlso got the Henry Burger as my partner loves burgers and we always try to get a burger to go when we go out but it was very bland and not noteworthy. We also asked for medium but it came out more well done. Fries were crunchy and crispy!",

I didn't relish them. I found the seating a bit congested but well I am aware space is limited in New York. I wouldn't mind going to the restaurant again but not my first choice hence 4 stars instead of 5.",

Very strong lemon flavor that reminded me of similar dishes I’ve tried in Italy.\n\nOverall, we thought they were all tasty but not too memorable.

The only seat we could get was 5 pm which was perfect actually time wise\n\nWe got quite a few things. Most of the chilled items were tiny as to be expected and didn’t blow me away. The best might have been the oyster mushrooms  they tasted better than the rich somehow.\n\nThe risotto was perfect. Best flavor of all the dishes.  But again just small. Can’t cost much to give a few more rice.\n\nWe ordered the special turbo fish. Which presentation was amazing. But honestly the meat of the dish didn’t have the flavor we really wanted in a special.  Taste didn’t meet presentation.\n\nThe sausage was also good. The allowed us to have a 3rd for 5 more dollars.

    "text": "Atmosphere: 7.5/10\nLocated in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, The Long Island Bar exudes classic American diner vibes with its neon signage and chrome accents. Inside, the high-backed booths, chrome-trimmed chairs, and laminated menus reinforce the nostalgic theme. While the decor is charmingly retro, the backbar is minimal, featuring mostly glassware without an extensive display of spirits. Music volume was well-balanced, complementing the ambiance without overpowering conversation.\n\nDrinks: 5/10\nRecommendation: Improved Pendennis Club\nThe cocktail menu is concise, presented in a simple, laminated diner-style format. Drinks leaned towards the sweeter side, lacking depth and complexity. Presentation was basic, with standard glassware, no coasters, and minimal garnishes.\n\nService: 6.5/10\nThe staff was friendly and attentive throughout the visit. Water was only provided upon request. Prices were slightly below average for New York.",

Their roasted veg dish and salmon tartare don were also delectable. Their barley tea was also superb with unlimited hot water refills. Their sushi however - somewhat underwhelming - average fish quality but fair price. I would come again for hot dishes",

Even the miso soup was delicious - which I didn’t expect to be so good! For my entree, I got the miso glazed salmon. It was well cooked, fresh, and had a great umami flavor.

    "text": "This place is so easy to miss..I’m actually not sure it has a sign out front. It probably does but I just went in without looking because my friends told me about it. Seems that that doesn’t slow down business. I went on a Thursday night an hour before closing and although the space\nisn’t large, it was packed. Lots of energy. I sat at the bar and had my usual …uni and fatty tuna. Both were fabulous (although the uni was $24 each vs the $15 I usually pay at other sushi houses). Can’t say that it was better than those for the price. I had a salmon sushi and immediately noticed\nthat there were none of those white veins (the typical grain that you see normally). I’ve never seen such a uniform slice of salmon. And it was as velvety as it could be. Along with it I had the seared king salmon belly. Truly wonderful flavors along with the richness of the species. The slight char offered a nice flavorful accent. I had the salmon roe only because I’ve never seen such large beads. Not sure that the flavor was different from normal sized roe but the texture was enjoyable. Finally, I had the hijiki seaweed salad. It was unlike any seaweed I’ve had. Don’t know that I can describe it as it was a totally new flavor for me. Perhaps a little earthy. Again, hard to describe but worth the experience. Sitting at the counter where 6 chefs were actively plying their trade, I saw some very uniquely presented sushi and maki rolls that made me want to try EVERYTHING. But I didn’t. I wasn’t that hungry and I would have departed with a $300 bill just for me WITHOUT beverages. I will definitely return. It is not common to have a sushi menu absolutely replete with creative options as could be found here. Great staff too. Very attentive and informative.",

Soft, pillowy, with this sweet crackly crust on top that threw me off at first… but the savory caramelized pork filling balanced it out. Not bad, kinda grew on me. 👌🏽\n\nBut the fried dumplings… y’all. They were sweet inside. I wasn’t ready for that at all, and honestly it ruined the vibe for me 😩.

We decided to walk around Soho while we waited as they text you when the table is ready and then you have 10 minutes to claim the table. After i put the phone in my pocket to walk around and wait, I was texted 3 minutes later to say my table was ready… but unfortunately I didn’t see the message until 15 minutes after I put my phone in my pocket. We walked back to the restaurant and we were told we could have a seat at the counter which we took.\n\nThe counter was great although the service was a little light and slow but I think that might be a theme throughout the restaurant. The restaurant was filled with young people but not super loud. The cocktail I had was good. The food was fine; not really remarkable compared to any other Thai restaurants throughout the city that can easily book reservations. I would not recommend the fries everyone talks about.

This was actually our second try if you want to get seated right away, come early. Otherwise, the wait can be up to 2 hours. This time we got lucky and didn't wait too long.\nThe restaurant is cute, but it's small and seating is limited. We tried quite a few dishes such as\nUncle Boon's Crab Fried Rice, coconut chicken thailandese, thai tea babka french toast, disco fries,  Pha Thai with Crispy Fried Chicken, Crispy Eggplant Maytinee, Rooibos and Chrysanthemum Tea.\nOur favorites were the roti, crispy fried chicken, eggplant, and the fried rice. The disco fries were also really good. The Phat Thai was decent, but had a too much peanut for my taste. The babka French toast was a miss for me it was too dry and the spread had an odd flavor.\nOverall, it's a cool spot to check out if you're into Thai food and don't mind a wait. There are definitely other great Thai places around too, especially if you're short on time. Staff were nice but understandable can be very busy.",

I was very curious how Mango Bay would measure up with their unique take that includes a Scotch bonnet sauce as well as a pimento sauce. I can say unequivocally and without hesitation, this is the absolute best shrimp and grits I have ever had in my life!!! The balance of flavor,  texture and freshness was only outdone by the masterful preparation of each component of this dish. One might be intimidated by the thought of a Scotch bonnet sauce but this chef has an unparalleled understanding of balance and it is clear that this dish was born from pure artistry and know-how!!! If you are a lover of shrimp and grits, as I am, this one is not to be missed! I would go so far as to say you have not had it right until you've had it here.\n\nI am told the steak and eggs were exquisitely prepared and the accompanying spicy aioli  highlighted the beautiful, perfectly prepared steak, sunny side up egg  and crispy ridged potatoes.\n\nThe service was warm and friendly and the restaurant's overall atmosphere is transportational to the islands.  Mango Bay is a true star of Caribbean flavor in Brooklyn. Try it, try it, try it! You will not be disappointed, nor will you find a flavor experience quite like this anywhere else in the city.",

I also loved the oxtail and the seafood pasta, but I wish it was mentioned on the menu that the pasta is spicy. I have a very low tolerance for spicy food, but it was still so buttery and delicious. The mango bae cocktail was my favorite and we even got a free drink, thank you!\nMy only complaint is the included gratuity of %20 which was odd for our party of two and it was nowhere mentioned on the menu. That’s the only reason for my 4 star review, but overall definitely worth checking out!",

All outstanding. The props shrimp and Johnny cakes 10 billion stars. Big prawns and the sauce I drank the bowl.  The Johnny cakes were the best I ever had. My favorite. The coconut ginger mussels again phenomenal. Drank that sauce too. The eggrolls were good. Nice contrast with cool creamy spicy dipping sauce. The homemade seafood pasta was fantaStic. The red snapper with cool Bacar sauce yes. The oxtail insanely good. Browning sauce great. The rice n peas were yummy. Very automatic. Mango chow is cool and refresh. The rum cake was the best I ever had a worth it.",

    "text": "So I would rate this restaurant a 7/10. I would say the atmosphere is nice, the food is good and the service was okay. The ackee n saltfish rolls was the best thing I had that night. The jerk chicken was very spicy, which I know how jerk is supposed to taste but it was overly spicy. The festivals paired with it, weren’t as sweet as expected and they felt very airy almost as if it was empty. I wish my dish came with rice n peas but I had to purchase that separately while the oxtail came with rice n peas. The rice itself was spicy which wasn’t expected either but it was still good 7.5/10. Then being that it was my birthday I was expecting maybe a little free dessert but unfortunately I didn’t get any. No one asked us if the food was good or not, kind of just seemed like a rush. Weren’t even finish with the appetizer and the entrees were brought out like 5 minutes after. Also the table we had was circled and small compared to everyone else’s so it wasn’t much room to eat. OVERALL 7/10. Wasn’t really worth that amount of money in my opinion.",

Stepping into the restaurant and speaking with the owner, Jade, is like stepping back into a time from when I was younger, before every restaurant was filled with gimmicks or aesthetics and portions were meant to fill you up. It's always nice to support small businesses in these times and especially when the owners are as kind as this one.\n\nI had never gotten Filipino food before and did not think I could ever have it as a vegan. I'm glad that this restaurant offers some authentic Filipino food (I had the adobo). For those who may want something different, they also have a wide variety of other foods and desserts. Their wings are some of the best vegan wings I've had. Also for those who don't know, these are the wings that were featured on the Hot Ones with Ariana Grande (the barbecue wings are great). They also offer a Hot Ones challenge for those who want to try some spice.\n\nHaving been here for 31 years, Red Bamboo deserves more attention. I'd highly recommend checking it out. I think it deserves a spot as a vegan staple in NYC amongst the many others.",

They add a 20% gratuity regardless of how many people are in your group. It was surprisingly calm for a Monday night, but the service was super fast. The aroma from the kitchen really drew us in; you could tell someone was cooking up a storm.\n\nWe went for the soft shell crab basket, and I definitely recommend having it there; it was super fresh. Each entree comes with two sides, so we picked the ribeye with broccoli and potatoes, and the butterfly snapper with Brussels sprouts and potatoes.\n\nBoth dishes were amazing, so we asked to meet the chef. Since it was a slow night, he was happy to chat. His name is Mohammed, and he hails from Senegal. If you get the chance to visit, I highly suggest trying either of the entrees. He was really appreciative of our compliments, saying he doesn’t get them often and seemed genuinely surprised.\n\nHe’s an awesome chef and is really bringing some fantastic flavors to theBoil Prime.",

I came between brunch and dinner so there weren’t too many people in the restaurant. The food came out fairly quick and everything was delicious though sometimes lacking in a few areas. The mole sauce was on the sweeter end but still good, I much prefer the verde sauce. Our waitress was great and friendly so shoutout to her. Wouldn’t hesitate to stop by again if I’m craving a particular dish, definitely stop by if you’re in the area.",

Food came quickly and we both really enjoyed our dishes. We also ordered the olive oil cake for dessert, which was probably the stand out of the meal.\n\nAll in all the total cost came to $120 (including tax and tip) which we thought was good value.

I got their version of a whiskey sour, the Black Kettle Sour, which was so good I had to stop myself from chugging it.  Their French onion soup was stacked with melty cheese and onion. I ordered the beef bourguignon pot pie which was so tasty. I will say the onion soup filled me up quickly with all the cheese so I had to take my time with the beef. Dessert was the wonderfully light pear panna cotta with oat crumble. Others in my party had the pork, burger,  steak frites, and rigatoni plus soufflé and doughnuts. No complaints anywhere. Is the price point higher than average neighboring places? Yes - but it’s a thousand times worth it. This is a must go for sure! The service was incredibly attentive. Water was always filled, table was kept clean, and the nicest people everywhere. I look forward to my next meal here!",

I normally don't mind a little chatter here and there, but it was so loud that I was borderline screaming just to have a conversation with the person across of me.

You can tell they’re working really hard and doing their best to keep up, and I really appreciated their good energy.

I waited about 45-55 minutes just for my order to start, and overall it ended up being over an hour. The young lady working was juggling so much at once — taking orders, running food, and even making drinks. It looked like way too much for one person to handle, and I felt bad because she really was trying her best.\n\nAs for the food, it wasn’t exactly my taste, but I know everyone has different preferences, so I’ll leave that part up to others to judge.\n\nOverall, I’m not upset — I just wanted to share my honest feedback. From what I saw, this place could really shine if they had more help for the staff. The employees are wonderful, but they definitely need more support.",

They make a whole show of serving it, chef comes to the floor, accompanied by fire, very presentable and fancy. It normally normally is served with side of rice.\nAll salads are excellent.\nHowever, during our last visit, I had ordered filet mignon combo with lobster tail and cannot recommend it - a huge disappointment - I asked for filet medium rare and it arrived way overcooked, looking more like a beef stew and lobster tail hardly had any meat on it .\nService was good, a lot of waitstaff, everything arrived timely, especially considering that they were fully booked, having had about 8+ large parties going .\nTheir Napoleon dessert is delicious.",

The energy of the place is just as memorable as the food, and together they create such a standout dining experience.\n\nWe started with the hummus, and it was absolutely outstanding—so fresh, silky smooth, and bursting with flavor. It paired beautifully with the warm bread and set the tone for the rest of the meal. The fries and sweet potato fries deserve a special mention too: perfectly crispy, piping hot, and honestly addictive. They’re the kind of sides you keep reaching for long after you’re full.\n\nFor mains, the lamb shawarma was excellent, with a distinctly gamey flavor that made it rich and satisfying without being overpowering. It felt authentic and hearty. But one of my favorite parts of the meal was the Israeli chopped salad on tahini. It was bright, refreshing, and balanced, with that creamy tahini base tying everything together beautifully. It was light yet flavorful, the kind of dish you could eat every day and never get tired of.\n\nEverything about Shoo Shoo—from the fresh, flavorful food to the great ambiance and attentive service—makes it a place I can’t wait to return to.

It was flavorful and not dry. The hummus and tahini were amazing. I believe the owner Yadin (I hope, I didnt butcher the spelling) also gave us home made hot sauce and it was great. You can tell he takes great passion in what comes out of that kitchen.\n\nI will say if you expect a quick bite or a grab and go then this is not the place. The food was made to order with great flavors and ingredients. Patience is a virtue with this spot but definitely worth it. Would easily recommend and come back. Glad to know this is in the area.",

Madi showed me a bunch of great wines from across the world with super detailed flavor profiles, truly a fun wine-tasting experience. From Italy, to Slovenia, I tasted notes of strawberries, chocolate, raspberry and more.\n\nShe also made impeccable food suggestions and I was blown away by the focaccia, ravioli and arracinhi. We topped it off with a tiramisu.\nFocaccia- crispy on the outside, soft, warm and buttery on the inside. The garlic and chili pepper paste to dip was a nice contrast to the usual olive oil at most spots.\nArracinhi- also very crispy. The star of the show here was the tomato sauce. Sweet and savory. Just straight up some great tomatoes.\nRavioli- Wow. Just WOW. A very happy marriage between lemon and creaminess. You would never guess it’s vegan. While it only came with 3 pieces, it was pretty filling. It also had these juicy mushrooms and sweet grape tomatoes that really added to the deliciousness.\nTiramisu- Delicious. Not too sweet, surprisingly a bit chocolatey. Great way to end the meal.\n\nI don’t eat a lot of vegan food but after this meal I’d like to add some vegan spots to my rotation. Even my boyfriend, who said he didn’t want to eat vegan food, will most definitely be coming back. I would be more than happy to try the rest of the food, cocktails, and wines at this spot. Soda Club is my newest obsession and go-to elevated date spot. The vibe is homey, romantic, and intimate, while also being funky and innovative with their menu.",

The staff went above and beyond to make the evening feel special, which is a rare find nowadays. The service was just…well, outstanding.\n\nThe vegan ricotta appetizer with bread and fresh tomatoes was my favorite of the couple we tried. As for the pasta, for me I really enjoyed the ravioli.

This is a very kid friendly place - so highly recommended for families with kids. At the same time, a great place for date night too.\n\nAn extremely well priced menu, with great options is how I'd describe their menu. Our order consisted of Crostini Misti ($10.50), Calamari ($18), Funghi di Prato ($12.50) - an excellent mushroom salad, for appetizers.\n\nMains included a very tasty (and slightly cheesy) Spinach Gnocchi ($18.50), Penne Arrabiata ($16), and Tagliatelle al Ragu ($18). Kids thoroughly enjoyed their butter pasta which they polished within a few mins!\n\nOverall, we had a great time at this place, and I can clearly see Malatesta become our go-to Italian dinner place on weekdays or weekends.

Our first time here was in 2021 - we spontaneously chose it for dinner as we were visiting the west village and got hungry while exploring. We had such a memorable experience that we made it a priority to come again in 2025 with our whole family. Same quality and service! We showed up at 5:20 on a Sunday with a party of 5 and got seated right away.  I’m both gluten intolerant and egg intolerant and found plenty of options in the menu with the guidance of our waiter.

The anchovy dish in particular was extremely disappointing: untoasted, cold slices of average bread, with unmelted butter and the anchovy on top is simply not a pleasant mouthfeel and it fails to bring out the flavors of each of the ingredients. The cocktails had a very syrupy mouthfeel and overly sweet flavor that masked any notes of the liquors used. Perhaps we \"ordered wrong\" but for the price it seems unacceptable that there would be wrong dishes to order.\n\nWe had one of each pici and they were good, but not enough to turn the evening around.

    "text": "Way better than expected.\n\nI'm a NY native and I've tried a lot of Korean food before. I have Cho Dang Gol almost once a month. I've tried Jungsik, Kisa, Tosokchon, Miss Korea, Kunjip, Olle, Her Name is Han etc...\n\nI went to Korea 3 times this year, for a total of 3 months in Seoul, Daegu, Busan, Jeju, Gyeongju, so at this point I feel like I can say you can trust my opinion on Korean cuisine at least a little bit.\n\nAnd what I think is, honestly, this may be the best Korean food in Brooklyn, and second best in the whole city only beaten by Chodanggol, which is saying a lot.\n\nThe food tastes nice and clean, showing that the cooking was done with care and good technique. The flavors actually reminded me of the same dishes from popular local restaurants in Seoul.\n\nI would recommend the\n- Hot Stone Bibimbap (Bulgogi)\n- Sundubu Stew (Pork)\n\nI also think eating in would be far better than takeout just so your food can be eaten at the ideal temperature and texture.\n\nDefinitely should give it a try!",

They were a little watery for my taste, but again not bad.\n\nThey had counter seating if you are rolling solo. Space is a bit tight, but manageable.

I was in the neighborhood and had a want for ramen and was surprised I’ve not been to this place as I’m familiar with some of the other Ramen shops in the area.\n\nI have to say this was a pleasant experience at this particular ramen spot.\n\nI will say the only downside isla that the pork was very few considering that some of the other places are a little more generous with pork for what you’re paying.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere for the most part is very inviting and calm which is very different from other places that seem busy and super loud.\n\nI also do appreciate that they do not give me the bums rush and they let me sit and relax after eating their good food and was even attentive to my want of water and refills.\n\nI didn’t eat their good food brown shredded stuff that was in the ramen as it is my first time trying it and my stomach wasn’t comfortable with it (Google just showed me that this stuff is called Wood ear mushrooms. Definitely not for me. I’ll ask them to leave it out next time).\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you’re in town or just wanting a different atmosphere to relax and eat.\n\nUPDATE: I am not a fan of bubble tea. However I tried this Milk Green Tea they shared with me and I have to say it’s quite delicious! I actually like it more without the bubbles! I know that sounds weird, but I’m very simplistic when it comes to food and sometimes simple is best! You should definitely try this drink!",

I’m originally from Texas and even though I’ve been gone from Texas for over a decade, it still gives me a lot of nostalgia vibes.\n\nMost times I’ve come here, I’ve made a reservation but it usually seems like walk-ins are available. I don’t believe they take reservations online, but you can make one over the phone.\n\nAs far as food, the queso and chips are so great and feels like TexMex quality. This is not a TexMex restaurant, to be clear, but it seems like standard Texas restaurant that offers a combination of Tex Mex and southern cuisine. Think of it as quirkier Willie’s Ice House. I also love the frito pie and the quesadillas. The frozen margaritas are some of the best in the city because they have a margarita machine whereas many places try to make them in a blender.\n\nSometimes certain servers can be a little cold or aloof, but generally they always get you what you need. I look forward to coming to this restaurant all the time and recommend it frequently, especially for groups.",

You should dress accordingly (optional, of course, but in my opinion, helps set the mood for you).  Well worth the trip down Austin st. (Or one of their other locations)",

We had a pescatarian dining with us at the time and our server helped pick out good tasting fish options and even substituted other things in the bento boxes for them. Speaking of the bento boxes, the presentation of the 4 ordered were so well done, and it was pleasing to both the eyes and the stomach. So delicious! Even the miso soup was great. We ordered something for takeout as well and it came nicely packed and very quick. The place itself is very comfortable to be in with a little chill now and then from the door but lights and even the cupboards looks very stylish. Everything was so clean and put together, and even the way they handled the plates made me feel safer about eating raw fish since it seemed so tidy. The only issue I had was that the ginger ale seemed to be watered down which was a bit strange, but it might have just been the ice",

He was patient when taking orders for a table of 7 with three checks. We ordered from the $20 lunch menu which was a pretty good value with a starter and meal. Portion was good for lunch. I actually had enough to take for later. The only thing none of us liked was the steak on the menu was an additional $10 which we felt shouldn't be an option if not in the $20 price point for the options. I had the chicken pasta with pesto sauce which was tasty. We sat outside and the water assisted us with the table placement so we could all sit together. The chairs weren't all that comfortable but it was nice being outside. I would return if in the area again.",

The crab cake was tasty, and it is mostly crab (which was excellent), but I felt for the price of $24 it was a bit small for that price.  Both my friend and I ordered steaks, her's was a touch over cooked as she wanted rare, mine was well cooked as I asked for medium-rare.  I really enjoyed the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  We opted for the outdoor seating as it was a gorgeous, cool summer evening.  I'd recommend this as a solid place to take a date as the establishment was great for having conversation, wasn't too loud at all.",

This is clearly a local favorite from the conversations we had with our neighboring tables but this was all destination dining for me and my best friend, Linette.\n\nLinette and I celebrated 35 plus years of friendship and are both originally from D.C.\nI live in New Zealand now and booked a hotel in Brooklyn specifically near Gertrude’s as I follow the chef Eli Sussman @gertrudesnyc - Partner/Exec Chef @talkininthewalkin on social media and was keen to try Gertrude’s with high expectations.\n\nThis election night  was magical  with the city feeling upbeat and positively giddy. I had told Gertrude’s it was our Frienniversery of 35 years and Allie the bartender greeted us with vodka beet juice shots that got the party started! Great introduction to Gertrude’s! Scott was our server with Lisa the floor manager stepping in at times to serve or check on us. Jacob and Reni were other servers that night on the floor.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Professional, of the highest standards, while warm and intimate. It’s an absolute pleasure when the service matches the excellence of the meal.\n\nGertrude’s was  outstanding Jewish Soul food, elevated comfort food to gladden the heart. We started with Challah Park rolls,Latkes with Crème Fraîche & Trout Roe and Beef Tongue Tartine. We were treated to Whitefiish & chips and housemade Spaetzle,  complimented from Gertrude’s. Everything was presented well: correct temperature, lovely plating. and delicious flavors. Ingredients balanced and complemented each other.\n\nLinette & I both had the 10oz Bavette Steak with sherry bordelaise, pickled shallot medium rare ( the best way!). The meat was beautifully marbled and perfect cooked. There was a choice of fries or salad greens. We chose fries.\nWonderful curated wine list to match and excellent recommendations from Lisa!\n\nTo finish, we had the Black & White ‘Seven Layer Cake’. My mom use to make us a chocolate layered cake with Sarah Lee pound cake (when guests over!) and it reminded me of being around the kitchen table with family and friends.\nA truly memorable dining out experience and evening that puts us in a New York State of Mind! A must experience in Brooklyn, New York.",

Our waiter agreed it was unacceptable and offered to replace the dish, which we appreciated. However, when the bill arrived, the replacement meal was still charged, and nobody apologized or made any gesture to acknowledge how serious the situation was.\n\nServing undercooked chicken is a major food safety issue, and the complete lack of accountability was shocking.

Will be increasing our rating from 1 to 3 stars to average our initial experience and the steps taken to rectify it.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nWe dined at Miriam this evening. The food was good, the patio atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately at the end of the meal, the staff member cleaning the dishes off the table accidentally toppled the dishes onto my partner, spilling on his shirt and pants. Both are ruined. Initially, we were told his meal would be comped. I expressed some dissatisfaction with this (his shirt and pants cost more than a burger) and they then agreed to comp the whole bill (there were three of us dining). This was a step in the right direction, but it took about 15 minutes for this to be offered after the incident. No manager ever came to speak with us/apologize. I think the proper way for the restaurant to handle the situation would have been for the manager to come out immediately and ask (and then cover) the price of the outfit. While I appreciate the offer to cover the table’s bill, the outfit still costs much more than our total, and it was naturally a major inconvenience. While I don’t blame the staff member for the accident - things happen! - I do think the restaurant should have handled the aftermath better.",

Was slightly disappointed that the grilled octopus appetizer was mostly salad with only some octopus bits on it— we expected the more octopus but it was still good.\n\nThe chocolate torta was the best I’ve had at Italian restaurants in nyc so far— the light whipped cream and tangy lemon zest brought out the creaminess and thickness of the chocolate even more.",

From the moment we reached out to gather information, to the actual event itself, everyone was beyond helpful, organized, and easy to work with. We planned a welcome dinner for our wedding in the Gallery space and it was absolutely perfect and beautiful. The room was set up so nicely, the staff were attentive and helpful, and the food was phenomenal. Our guests were so happy with the evening and the dinner. They even accommodated very specific dietary restrictions with no issue. I would highly recommend using Rosemary’s for an event and hope that we can have another event there in the future!",

    "text": "I've been enjoying King David's Mediterranean food since the mid-70's. The original restaurant on Marshall Street was established by the father of the current owners who worked for their dad as young men. When the father retired, the business was divided, with one son opening a new restaurant in Fayetteville and the other taking over the Marshall Street location, but moving to a smaller upstairs space. Having eaten at both restaurants, it is my opinion that the larger Fayetteville restaurant serves the best food. The chicken pesto pizza is an excellent starter for 2-4 to share. The platform is a 12\" piece of crispy pita bread topped with delicious cheese, chicken, black olives, tomatoes, and pesto sauce. For your main course, try the babagnouge ala carte platter which includes salad, pita bread, and a falafel patty, or order the chicken shish kabob over rice which comes with salad, falafel, pita bread, and hummus. Other items on the menu that we love include the beef chawarma sandwich, the Greek salad with chicken, and when it's available, the mushroom soup. For something different, try the apricot nectar as a beverage. I think it pairs well with the food, particularly if you make liberal use of the hot sauce. At the far end of the dining room, there's a door leading to a skylight-lit patio that's pleasant in the summer. For lunch, you place your order at the register as you enter and it's delivered to your table. At dinner, you are seated and the waitstaff takes your order and brings your food. Service is excellent and the environment is relaxed and comfortable. UPDATE-1: It seems that the pita bread may be thinner than it once was. The beef shawarma sandwich falls apart pretty easily. Delicious with added Frank's Red Hot, but a little messy. UPDATE-2: I was up for a light lunch and chose a Greek salad without chicken. It served the purpose perfectly and tasted great. UPDATE-3: Even though the fattoush salad is no longer on the menu, the staff kindly prepared it for me. It was very good, but I do prefer the Greek salad.",

The pizza had an excellent tasty sauce, all the the toppings were spot on, and wood burning taste of the smoke just gave it the extra flavor like it should have.

I'm wondering why someone in Manlius didn't dream up a place like this 42 years ago when I was in high school. The Pizza is insane. As good as any place, anywhere I've been including NYC and Italy. I had some special pizza that had like everything I love..cabbage roasted pork and some kinda cooky, delicious hipster sauce drizzled over it and the first bite was heavenly as was the last. Wood fired, crunchy and savory all at the same time. The staff is and was fantastic the two nights I was there. They are on top of everything and polite (a lost art form). Everyone is  happy to be working there and super helpful with picking out the beverage and pizza of your choice.  The atmoshphere is just as cool as the name of the business. It's a bustling and super hip joint thats both modern age and old school for us old people with authentic decor true to the year it was built (which I love). It checks every box for a 10 outta 10 establishment. The owners hosted a movie showing  last weekend and took care of the movie guests really well so that was just amazing too. Great work Dan and Joe you hit a grand slam. Can't wait to get back there to M town.. Cudos to the Mayor too!",

    "text": "Found Ciao on Trip Advisor under “best gluten-free restaurants in Ithaca.” Lived up to the hype. Love the stylish yet casual environment. It was busy when we arrived but it still took less than 5 minutes to sit. The host gave us a booth with a view of the wood-fired pizza oven, which was greatly appreciated. I’m glad my girlfriend was in the mood for gluten-free Italian, which is what prompted my search in the first place. We wanted to try something new in the Ithaca area.\n\nService was excellent from start to finish. Our waitress was great. She was very attentive without coming across as overbearing. She did a great job of staying one step ahead at every opportunity.\n\nThe house bread dipped in the garlic-infused, seasoned oil was amazing. It set the right tone for our taste buds. Our entrees arrived before our appetizer. Although we didn’t mind, management apologized and didn’t hesitate to deduct the appetizer from the bill. They proceeded to serve the appetizer a few minutes after that. This made quite the impression on us because they did not have to do that. And I love a business that acts in good faith.\n\nThe meatball appetizer is highly recommended. I had a pasta dish that was similar to Utica’s chicken riggies. Every dish we had that involved red sauce tasted amazing.\n\nMy only constructive criticism is regarding the pear and gorgonzola pizza. I think this pizza could use more pear slices to help balance the dominant flavor of the gorgonzola. The tastiest bites included the pear. And perhaps this pizza could benefit from a drizzle (the aforementioned garlic oil, pesto, or balsamic would be perfect). I should have asked about adding a drizzle, given that this pizza was a bit on the dry side. It still tasted great and we were super happy with our food.\n\nWe wanted to try dessert and we opted for the chocolate mousse. It was the perfect dessert because you don’t need much room to eat it. And the chocolate mousse had a rich flavor without being too sweet.\n\nOverall, Ciao left a great impression on us. I would highly recommend this place. And next time I’m in the Ithaca area, I can’t wait to return to Ciao.",

It’s the kind of dish you think about the next day and consider going back for. The rest of the menu is beautifully plated and thoughtful. Portions lean upscale (not huge), but the flavor more than makes up for it.\n\nService:\nFriendly, polished, and just attentive enough without hovering. Our server gave great recommendations and didn’t make us feel rushed, even on a busy night.\n\nAmbiance:\nThis place is sleek. Dark wood, soft lighting, cool touches everywhere. The bathroom was a standout. It’s one of those places where you walk in and go, “Oh… this is nice.” Great for a date night or a special occasion dinner that’s not stuffy.\n\nOverall:\nOiji Mi nails that upscale-but-still-fun balance. Come hungry, get the lobster ramyum, and maybe take a bathroom selfie while you’re at it. Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Our dining experience at Oiji Mi was a study in contrasts, showcasing moments of genuine quality alongside significant operational flaws. Considering the substantial bill of $1,119.26 for four people (excluding service) in a casual setting, the disparity between expectations and reality was notable.\n\nCuisine Identity and Execution:\nWhile positioned as 'Korean fusion,' many courses across the menu felt confused in their identity. The utilization of certain spices and vegetables did not clearly anchor the dishes within a distinct Korean gastronomic framework, leaving the fusion border ambiguous. However, specific dishes excelled:\n• The Main Galbi (Short Rib): Perfectly cooked and served with a beautifully balanced soy-based sauce that offered deep satisfaction.\n• Black Sugar Bingsu: A sophisticated and impeccably executed dessert that served as a fantastic conclusion to the meal.\n\nBeverages:\nWe selected two bottles of wine, including a Dr. Bürklin-Wolf (Pfaltz) white and the Littorai (Anderson Valley) red. The Other Half Brewery Green City DDH Hazy IPA was also ordered and impressed with its rich aromatic profile. The quality of the beverages themselves was not in question.\n\nThe Critical Failure: Service and Management:\nThe service was the most disappointing factor, falling far short of the standard one expects from a Michelin-starred establishment.\n• Staff Engagement: Waiters and front staff displayed a noticeable lack of focus and enthusiasm for guest interaction, exhibiting an indifferent, minimal-effort approach more aligned with a casual eatery.\n\n• Sommelier's Conduct: The sommelier was overtly promotional, intentionally topping up partially full wine glasses to empty the bottle quickly and pressure an additional purchase. This felt like aggressive salesmanship rather than professional beverage service.\n\n• Operational Oversight: Staff members were frequently observed engaging in personal conversation, distracting them from attending to dining guests. This highlighted a serious lack of focus and suggests an amateurish approach to floor management.\n\nWhile flashes of excellent flavor were present, the experience was ultimately overshadowed by the restaurant's ambiguous culinary direction and the indefensibly poor quality of service that did not justify the high price point. Given the wealth of more refined and consistently executed Korean fine dining options in New York City, a return visit is highly unlikely. Oiji Mi urgently needs to address staff training and management oversight to align its hospitality standards with its Michelin accolade.",

The setting was beautifully designed: the round table felt intimate and romantic, giving us a perfect view of the chefs at work, adding a layer of magic to the whole evening.\n\nEvery dish was a visual delight — absolutely stunning plating that I’ve never seen before in Korean cuisine. Each course was refined, flavorful, and full of personality. From seafood to meat to elevated takes on traditional Korean flavors, we were blown away by the creativity and depth of the menu.\n\nThe cocktail is exceptional !The staff were warm, super professional, attentive, and so thoughtful, absolutely top service! They even surprised me with a beautifully presented birthday dessert, which made the night feel extra personal.\n\nChef Brian Kim’s vision is remarkable — elegant, modern, yet deeply rooted in Korean tradition. The location is great, the vibe is sophisticated yet cozy, and we just found out there’s another concept by the chef right inside the same space. We’re already planning to return and explore more of his brilliant work.\n\nA truly unforgettable evening — one of the best dining experiences we’ve ever had in New York!",

A baffling mix of yellow and black lentils with random Rajma thrown in, cooked in a “unique” way that defies human understanding. Let me be clear: by no standards on this planet is this Dal Makhni.\n\nI asked for HOT spice level and got… dessert?? A bizarrely sweet dal that left me wondering if they confused “spicy” with “sugary.”\n\nThe rice? Weapon-grade hard. I nearly broke a tooth trying to crack them — clearly designed for people with titanium jaws and cast-iron stomachs. And the naan? Good luck. It was like chewing through a piece of hardened leather; I’m pretty sure medieval shields were softer.\n\nHonestly, this feels slightly less than a conspiracy against Indian food — more like a full-blown attack. What a shocking waste of time, money, and calories.\n\nIf they want to keep serving “Indian food,” someone on their team urgently needs to get on a plane to India and take notes.

We ordered the Buffalo Ricotta with orange honey, meat stuffed rice ball, and Norma pizza with tomato, mozzarella, basil, eggplant, and ricotta. The Buffalo ricotta tasted sweet and could have been served as a dessert. The pizza dough had a flaky crust and the eggplant melted in your mouth which I really enjoyed. The rice ball was stuffed with meat and tasted savory but not too salty. Great restaurant to try before seeing a Broadway show.",

Apparently, the cook likes red pepper flakes, but that is only one spice. The mains were hot temperatures but the sides weren't. The staff were busy and never asked if we wanted drink refills or dessert. A $30 appetizer platter was good but only came with what looked like one cut pita for four to share... Then they charged $2 when we requested one more. They are in a very busy neighborhood full of very good restaurants. Please up your game.",

There are parts we just tried to stop the waiters from keep coming with meat.\nIt’s was very tasty and plenty of it.\nThe salad bar was ok. Seen better but we didn’t come for the salad bar. It has plenty of option but it just didn’t talk to us.\nWe ordered deserts. You can leave without deserts. It was ok but not great.\nI would stick with the meat. Unless you just have to finish with something sweet.\nOverall it was a good experience. A bit pricey but compared to what you get and compared to NY prices it was reasonable",

My family and I had previously gone to the Fogo de Chao in NYC and we were utterly disappointed in all aspects. For my birthday, we decided to give this a try having heard good things online, and boy were they right!\n\nThe food is fantastic. Good quality, comes out fast, well seasoned. The salad bar, the meat, and the deserts! It met the expectations we had of an authentic Churrascaria. The Passion Fruit Mousse and Fried Polenta in particular was to die for.\n\nMaybe even more impressive than the food was the service. Everyone was very warm and attentive, and with a pace in their step. You can tell that they have the Brazilian work ethic of BEING A TEAM, everyone helps each other with everything. You never feel like you need to find \"your waiter\". Again, it was my birthday, and they made it special with a cheesecake and everything.\n\nA special thank you to Angel, Marcondes, and Portoncello for taking care of us and providing us with warm service.\n\nWe finally found a good Churrascaria in NYC! Will be back!!",

I had a bunch of different stuff from the salad bar my favorite being the potato salad. My gf loved the sushi and other fish from the salad bar. We got back to the table and record our appetizers which just keep coming I choose cheese balls and she picked fries. The whole experience was very good. They also brought us out a piece of cake after for our anniversary. We left very happy and very full. Just be ready to pay, it is not cheap  but definitely worth a try 🙂",

The atmosphere had an almost luxury designer store vibe - polished and exclusive, but not at all welcoming. There’s also virtually no privacy; you’re seated barely a foot away from other diners, which makes the whole experience feel cramped and uncomfortable. The dishes themselves could’ve used more seasoning, especially for the price. Beware - an automatic 20% gratuity may or may not be added to your bill, even when your party doesn’t exceed 6 diners indicated on the menu (we only had two and it was added to our bill). Overall, it clearly caters to a very specific crowd, and the visit left me more disappointed than impressed.",

I remember going to the other location in downtown and having an amazing time, especially the food, drinks and the vibe! This location didn’t quite measure up.\n\nThe spicy guacamole lacked real heat and was more mild. The shrimp tacos were just okayish—it missed that fresh, vibrant flavor I was hoping for.\n\nWe ordered a guava margarita pitcher and it was a letdown as well! Tasted more like a syrupy cocktail mix than a refreshing drink.\n\nWhat did stand out for me though was the friendly and attentive host. She made the experience more pleasant for us.\n\nWhile nothing was particularly bad, but nothing really impressed us either. It’s a good spot for a casual meal, but it doesn’t deliver the same quality or flavors as the other location.",

The Yakiniku udon was my fav as the stir fried made the noodles very flavorful (sweet and savory taste). The steak was cooked well - crispy on outside, soft on inside.\nThe servers were very nice. Checked in on us multiple times and made sure our water was always full.\nInside was a bit small but cozy enough.",

The service was warm and friendly, and the inside of the restaurant was very cozy. Other customers seemed to be regulars, and the staff know them, which I found very charming. And after tasting the food, I can definitely see why people keep coming back! Everything we tried was delicious, and the portion sizes were very generous. I enjoyed the variety of both more standard Thai fare as well as creative and modern twists on the old favorites. The Tom Yum Fried Rice was something I had seen home cooks make online, but I don't think I've ever seen it on a restaurant menu before (and I've been to a lot of Thai places!). I knew I had to try it and it did not disappoint! Of course everything was delicious but that really stood out. It's obvious why Udom is a neighborhood staple that has stood here for many years: with a friendly and warm atmosphere and delicious food served with fresh ingredients, no matter where you come from it makes it feel a little bit like home.",

It was so freshly yakitori was the best I ever had. It’s Michelin rated and the service was excellent. The yakitori chefs really listened to what my preferences were so I really enjoyed every bite. The prefix Omakase meals totally worth it. It’s so much food. Totally worth it!!!",

They offer a full yakitori omakase experience for $148pp which takes you on a full journey through the art of Japanese yakitori. Each skewer is grilled over binchotan charcoal bringing out a smoky aroma and juicy, layered flavors that are absolutely mouthwatering. Seasonal selections keep the experience fresh and surprising, and pairing everything with different sake makes it even more memorable. Torishin staffs are warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about what they’re serving. They take time to explain each skewer, offer thoughtful recommendations, and strike the perfect balance between professionalism and making you feel completely at home. If you’re looking for authentic yakitori elevated to the highest level, this is the place to go!",

It’s definitely more upscale than the spots I used to frequent, but I was excited to see what they’d do.\n\nI went with the omakase, though I liked that they also offer individual skewers a la carte. Sitting counter side was a lot of fun—the team clearly knows their craft, and it was great to watch everything being cooked right over the charcoal. Every bite was excellent—tender, flavorful, and full of smoky charcoal depth. My favorite of the night was the chicken oyster. If you like chicken, it really doesn’t get better than that. Service was outstanding and made the evening even more enjoyable. Overall, a wonderful experience. I’ll definitely be back.",

From the moment I stepped inside, the staff made me feel so welcomed and at ease - I instantly knew I was going to have a good time. I chose the Omakase option, which was a perfect way to try a range of dishes even though I'm not the most adventurous eater. The staff were incredibly thoughtful, checking in with my friend and me ahead of our meal to see if we preferred certain cuts of meat so they could tailor the experience to our individual tastes.\n\nThroughout the meal, our server was attentive and knowledgeable, always nearby to answer questions and make sure we were comfortable and enjoying everything. Watching the chef prepare each course right in front of us made the atmosphere even more special and added to the night!\n\nAs for the food itself - it was absolutely incredible. My favorite dishes were their popular chicken \"scallops,\" which were so juicy and flavorful, and the gindara fish, which was perfectly flaky and delicious.\n\nBetween the warm service, the amazing food, and the lively, welcoming atmosphere, Torishin truly gave me a night to remember. I can't wait to come back!",

The service, however, was the real standout—attentive, friendly, and perhaps better than the food. The atmosphere is classic New York, with walls covered in vintage movie posters and black-and-white photos that give it an old-school charm.

On another visit there I tried their rabbit that came with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The rabbit ($49.50) had lost a lot of its flavor due to its preparation.

While the wait can definitely be long during peak hours(1hr 30min on a Sunday evening), Raku SoHo is a cozy spot that delivers authentic noodles and thoughtful dishes once you’re seated.\n\nFor an appetizer you must try the chicken tatsuta-age which is wonderfully fried and seasoned. We loved the dipping sauce which perfectly compliments the chicken. We tried two hot udons, the tantan and the nabeyaki.\n\nThe tantan offered a rich and flavorful broth while not being too overwhelming. My only complaint would be that most of the pork and other components were under the noodles so I didn’t discover them until I was almost finished. The nabeyaki was a nice light soup with the same perfect noodles. It offered a lot of protein and a nicely balanced fishy flavor. The stand out of this dish was the shrimp tempura which was fried to perfection.\n\nMy only complaints would be of the tight seating arrangement. You will be practically sharing a table with the people around you if you are seated near the front. Overall, I cannot wait to come again and try more of their udon!",

She attended to our needs and was very helpful. I had a question about what one of the dishes was and she looked it up on her phone to show me what it was.\n\nThe food definitely blew me away. It was surprisingly good. We had the crispy spring rolls, classic fried rice(Chicken), pad Thai (chicken), and a mango avocado salad. The fried rice was amazing. I've always prefer Thai fried rice compared to other Asian fried rices. It didn't taste super greasy and it had the right amount of eggs and chicken and vegetables. The salad was perfectly riped. A great combo of mango and avocado with onions/cashews and an Asian sauce. Very fresh and delicious. The crispy spring rolls came in a set of 4. They tasted great are also a nice size, not too small. It was paired with a sweet chili sauce for dipping.The pad Thai was delicious 🤤 not too dry and just the right amount of oil. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The portion was a great size. I ended up taking the fried rice and pad Thai in a to go container. She was nice enough to box up the food for us.\n\nWe also ordered Thai tea. It was the final piece of the puzzle to balance out the spicy meals.\n\nWe definitely recommend this place. Everyone please try it. Would definitely try again if we're in the area.",

    "text": "Thep Thai truly stands out, not just for its vibrant atmosphere, but for the exceptional quality and flavor depth found across its entire menu, especially in its vegetarian and chicken offerings.\n\nFor those seeking plant-based dishes, Thep is a revelation. The menu is clearly labeled with excellent vegan options, and the kitchen handles substitutions perfectly. The Vegan Pad See Ew with tofu is arguably the best I’ve ever had—rich, smoky, and perfectly textured. Don't skip the Avocado Massaman Curry (available vegetarian/vegan), which is wonderfully creamy, savory, and loaded with tender sweet potato. The commitment to flavorful, authentic vegan food here is top-tier.\n\nOn the non-vegetarian side, the chicken dishes are equally impressive. The Chicken Pad Thai is a classic for a reason, hitting that perfect balance of sweet and tangy tamarind flavor. However, the real showstopper is the Chicken Khao Soi (Northern Thai Egg Noodles)—the creamy coconut curry broth is incredibly deep and comforting, and the chicken (often bone-in, which adds to the authenticity) is cooked to perfection. It's an absolute must-try.\n\nWhether you're visiting for a comforting chicken classic or looking for sophisticated, flavorful vegan Thai, Thep delivers consistently high quality and is highly recommended.\n\nMinnie was awesome to help us with our order. A big thanks to her and entire staff for making our lunch good",

It was smooth and beautiful.\n\nI ordered lobster bisque, a NY strip cooked medium rare, and a side of toasted wild mushrooms.\n\nThe bread was quite nice. They gave me one nice looking one and a one that was kinda ugly. Turned out, the look did matter. The nice looking one was way softer than the ugly one.\n\nThe lobster bisque was nice. Very pungent and thick. It also had a generous amount of lobster claws meat chunks. However, some of them were a bit overcooked and some were perfectly tender.\n\nThe NY strip came out pretty well. The meat was pink and tender. Very flavorful. It came with roasted garlic. The garlic was smooth like mashed potatoes, and it was fragrant but not stinky.\n\nThe side of roasted wild mushrooms was very nice, too. Usually, they can be a bit oily and greasy, but here, they were cooked to almost perfectly. Almost, because they were a bit bland, and they were a bit too dry.\n\nOverall, it was a nice restaurant with a good atmosphere. Even though, I still wish they could pick up the speed a bit. Between the time I finished my lobster bisque and my NY strip was served, I waited for 35 minutes. They can probably do that for the party of 2 or more, but for a person who was eating by himself, I’d like to just finish and leave.",

Service is slow and non attentive at best. Steak was bland , sides were same and the bacon barely cooked even when sent back and asked for it well done came back out the same . Waiter was robotic no personality , not what you expect from a “steakhouse” waiter . Overall aside from a drink and maybe a quick app at bar this place really should do better or change the name . Sub par across the board minus the atmosphere.",

It was easy to make a reservation through Google maps, the table was ready right away, the staff is very courteous and accommodating.\nWe came primarily for drinks 🍹 and were not disappointed: all three tequila cocktails were unique and delicious. Our server was also very knowledgeable about their origin and the making. The buratta salad is at the top of my salad list now! It’s like a meal by itself to my European standards and the concoction of tastes makes it truly unforgettable and wanting me to return there for just this one dish 🙃",

It has that old-school diner feel with counter seating and friendly staff who actually remember regulars. They still make their Coca-Cola the traditional way from syrup mixed right in front of you which gives it a flavor you can’t find anywhere else. The coconut cake is a must-try, super moist with that perfect balance of sweetness. They also serve all the classic diner favorites like omelets, egg sandwiches, and pancakes, all made fresh and served hot. It’s a simple spot, but that’s part of what makes it so good  just classic comfort food in a nostalgic setting. Definitely worth a visit if you want a taste of old New York.",

This is just hyped up to be a tourist trap.\n\nBut don’t get me wrong, the vibes and ambience is spot on! Typical American diner but the rude behavior of staff and the prices are exorbitant like grilled cheese is $10 and it’s not even on sourdough bread.\n\nThe only reason we went to try was the Coca Cola float as they seem to be making the Coca Cola the old school way.\n\nSo in short, the ambience 10/10 as it has a pretty decent history around the upper east side, the food not so much.",

Spaghetti with clams had tiny clams and the flavor was quite ordinary—I’ve had this dish at many Italian restaurants in the United States and in various towns in Italy. This dish here is only ordinary. The pasta is not al dente, and the olive oil didn’t taste like high-quality Italian olive oil, and the clams are just too small, and perhaps it’s lacking some garlic flavor (in Italy this dish is usually cooked with garlic and the olive oil and parsley flavors should stand out as well as the vongole). For the price they charge, I expect better. Appetizer was very good though, still portion size is quite small compared to other Italian restaurants in UWS. The puttanesca is good though a bit salty.\n\nThey have both indoor seating and sidewalk seating. Sidewalk seating is on a busy main street so you might get some strange reactions from passersby.",

Adding some mint and nuts made for the perfect bite.  Meat and cheese platter was also very good, the meats was sliced very thin which was great, but I would have appreciated if they told us the types of cheeses we were eating (the meats were obvious). Also would have like to have known what the garnish was as I couldn’t place it, it didn’t taste strong enough to be candied ginger but it may have been.    I did ask what all of these were and was told someone would come and explain but they never did. Bread basket was a combination of toasted and fresh bread served with tasty olive oil.    When you first walk in there is a counter where they sell their meats, cheeses and salads, all looked delicious and while we were they the counter was very busy.

    "text": "Saiguette is one of those hidden gems in NYC that consistently delivers when it comes to Vietnamese comfort food, especially for takeout. I’ve tried a good amount of Vietnamese spots in the city, and while Saiguette doesn’t offer a dine in experience (it’s strictly takeout), they make up for it with flavor, portion size, and speed.\n\nThe banh mi here is definitely the standout. Unlike some places that skimp on the fillings, Saiguette really loads it up. The bread is fresh with the perfect balance of crunch on the outside and softness inside, and the fillings are generous you don’t feel like you’re paying just for bread. I also appreciated that the balance of meat, pickled vegetables, and fresh herbs is done right, giving it that satisfying bite every time. Portion wise, it’s more than fair for the price, especially considering NYC standards where you often pay more for less.\n\nPho and other noodle dishes also come packed with flavor. The broth is rich, and the portions again don’t leave you hungry. For a takeout-only spot, the packaging is practical and sturdy it travels well, and you can enjoy it at home without everything spilling or getting soggy.\n\nThe one downside for me was more about the ownership and authenticity. When I asked if the restaurant was Vietnamese owned, one of the workers told me yes. Later on, I found out that the owner is not Vietnamese, which was a bit disappointing, especially after I tried speaking Vietnamese to him and realized it wasn’t the case. It doesn’t take away from the taste of the food, but as someone who values authenticity and cultural roots, it felt misleading.\n\nOverall, though, Saiguette is worth trying if you’re in NYC and craving Vietnamese food. The quality, portion size, and fair pricing make it a solid choice, especially for banh mi lovers. While I wish the ownership had been upfront about the background, I can’t deny that the food itself is good and consistent.",

When I asked why, I was completely ignored. On top of that, the older lady at the register showed zero interest in serving me. She pinched the money from my hand like she didn’t even want to take it. The combination of ridiculous price hikes and rude service makes this place a hard pass for me. Definitely not worth it!",

Light, tasty, and a fantastic appetizer. For mains, we had the Goat (Hilib Ari) and the Lamb Shoulder. The lamb was a little on the dry side, but the goat was absolutely sublime—so tender it melted in your mouth, with amazing flavors and seasoning.

I ordered 2 lunch specials and paid about $30 total. It was around 2 pm on a Friday and there were just 2 people dining in. The decor is probably the best thing about this place. It makes you feel like you’ve stepped outta Brooklyn, right into Thailand. The dumplings were yummy but that’s about it. Food was basic and bland. The presentation was there at all (they could’ve done better even for take out). The crispy fried chicken that’s supposed to go with one of the rice looked like a damn joke. The girl behind the bar seemed annoyed that I asked for a menu like ma’am. Let’s be so forreal ! She also had an attitude with the couple who were drinking because their meal was incorrect.

For the main course, the Kai Tod Had Yai special was beautifully prepared, flaky, and seasoned to perfection. They even adjusted the spice level of the Rua Volcano to be milder just for us, and it was delightful.\nThe team at Rua Thai demonstrated remarkable attentiveness.

    "text": "RUA Thai is a cozy Thai restaurant in Brooklyn with a warm and relaxed atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the service is smooth.\n\nThe Grab Curry (soft shell crab curry) is the highlight — rich flavor, real Thai spice, and very delicious with rice. The Thai Iced Tea is creamy and helps balance the heat.\n\nThe cocktail Chili & The Moon is fun and unique. It’s made with mezcal and mango puree, and it comes with sweet crispy fish snacks on the side — surprisingly tasty.\n\nThe Steak & Egg Teriyaki Fried Rice is also very good. The steak is tender and the egg on top makes the rice extra flavorful.\n\nFor dessert, the Mango Coconut Sticky Rice is fresh and sweet, with strong coconut flavor.\n\nOverall, great food, real Thai taste, and a nice place to relax. Definitely worth trying!",

Salmon was cooked perfectly.\n\nPancakes were so good. Crisp edges and fluffy goodness. Hard to share this.\n\nEggs Benedict - good, potatoes could have been a tad more seasoned but they were cooked nicely.

    "text": "So crazy thing but I must say, worst thing here is the pancake. I know it gets all the hype and the other reviews are true, crispy edges and fluffy inside but that’s literally it. The actual pancake has no flavor and needs syrup. I am a fan of specialty pancakes with the fruit in flavor baked/cooked in. If you want a classic pancake that requires copious syrup, here you go! Otherwise skip that. Otherwise the food was shockingly good. We got a couple sunny side eggs and sausage (delicious of course), the open faced grilled chicken sandwich and chips and guacamole….that might have been the best chips and guacamole I’ve ever had. And based on the comments about the chilaquiles I think the sleeper here is the Mexican food. The grilled chicken sandwich was good, great sauce and stuffed once you tried to close it. The sourdough was delicious and toasty. I saw another table order chips and guacamole and clearly got more chips than us so they aren’t standardized with that unfortunately. Our service was also incredibly slow. I saw people who sat after us get food, drink, and get order taken before us. We waited about 20 min to get our orders taken and the food took long to come out. Unfortunately sandwich is not pictured. The Shirley temple was quite good per my bf but I gave up soda for lent so didn’t try. But it was so good he ordered two. I got apple juice and I’m not sure why I got a smaller cup, that’s always a pet peeve of mine, different size cups for juice vs soda or tea. Anyways I would definitely come back for Tex mex night or something else. Menu was extensive and a lot of things (salad, sandwich, pasta) looked good. Once again MUST DROP A STAR IF YOU’RE CASH ONLY IN 2025.",

I've been here many times and have never left unsatisfied.\n\nIs it the best Italian you've ever had, especially in a city like New York? Probably not.

They have a lot of employees that have been there for years and very much care for the clientele they serve and they make an effort to actually remember you.\n\nI'm a fan of their frequent rotating dinner specials that change from season-to-season. They rarely miss. I've also never had something off of their main menu that I've ever disliked, and I love to try new things, so it's nice to have a wide spread to let you adventure out, but you can always find the regular go-tos as well.\n\nIt's a relief to have somewhere that you can trust like them in Hudson Heights.\n\nThe wife and I are a big fan of their bottomless brunch on the weekends. Their back patio is a gorgeous little cozy nook in the middle of the city that blocks out all of the noise from the busy street in front of it.\n\nSince they changed out the old tables to booths, the ambiance has felt very cozy. Vibes are on-point.\n\nIf you come back frequently, you'll see a lot of regulars at the bar during happy hour, and people aren't afraid to engage in conversation, which is abnormal (and welcome) in recent times.

She is extremely rude, disrespectful, and talks to customers in a very unprofessional way. Yesterday she even overcharged me for two slices — almost $14— and I only noticed when I got home. I paid with a credit card, so I didn’t see the total right away.\nHer attitude is unacceptable. I hope the management pays attention to this, because customers shouldn’t be treated like this.\n\nUPG: Please listen to me for a moment. I completely understand that you are a family-run business, and maybe this cashier is your relative — your sister, daughter, or someone close. But that does not give her the right to speak to customers in a raised voice, be disrespectful, rude, or make personal comments.\n\nTo be honest, I really like your pizza. I like the place, the atmosphere, everything. But I will never come back again — not because of your food or prices, but because of this one cashier. And as long as she continues to work there, I personally will not return.\n\nI have also spoken with several neighbors in our area, and everyone says the same thing — her rudeness is not only toward customers, but also toward delivery workers and even other staff.

Even a basic slice is as pricey as you'd pay down on Bleecker Street, so don't expect any uptown discount. But their Vodka Slice worth every damn penny. The wife and I prefer to come in and get various slices between the two of us, because a whole pie can set you back over $30 at times.\n\nPro Tip: Pay in cash. Pay a little less.\n\nAs with most other spots in the 'hood, you'll be left supplementing your own salt and seasoning, because the aging demographic has a stranglehold on every restaurant in the area in regards to sodium content. The white-haired rabble generally want the bare minimum. And they complain about. A lot. I guess they're salty enough.\n\nFresco's also has a nice spread of different slices--especially white pies--which is pretty unique to most other spots in the city, who only offer red pies. They're absolutely a class above most other pizza joints in the neighborhood.\n\nIt's a family run shop, so you'll see the same people behind the counter time after time. Most of the time they're pretty friendly, especially the dudes baking your slices, they go the extra mile to keep you returning and will make small talk if they're not overwhelmed. Good fellas.\n\nIf you haven't been inside and only walked by outside, you've assuredly dodged the swath of bikes and delivery guys outside that make it look like a post-apocalyptic bicycle gang occupies their space, but it just turns out they're one of the most delivered pizza joints in the entire US, so I can only assume they know what they're doing to keep people happy.

I do have one small complaint that we opted to order the LARGE Henny Colada cocktails but were not warned that they were $60 each!! Luckily,we could afford it but I know that it could be a problem for some people. The drinks were tasty, strong and had 3 small Hennessy bottles as floaters do they were totally worth the $ but still, a little warning would've been nice.\n\nEvery single dish had soooo much flavor!!",

Indulge if you must.\nFirst time here at the UrbanCoveSociety (is this related to the Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society?), drawn by the promise of good branzino and real tablecloths 🙄, part of the 33 Seaport Hotel.\nQuietish early on a Sat evening. The decor could use a hand, me thinks, but great low-key music.\n\nThe branzino (European seabass) came fileted (not whole per pictures) and did not disappoint! Was so impressed I forgot photo... maybe it was the cognac... Intriguing lemon chili dressing, supported graciously by oodles of garlic in my spinach side order. Recommended.\nLast but not least, the banana bread pudding was a bit firmer than my dessert fork grip expected, but matched well by excellent caramel ice cream so overall very good.",

We waited about 4 mins before we actually saw someone.\n\nWe were seated and offered some water.  No one introduced themselves through the whole process. The restaurant was cool, and the atmosphere was chill. It was not a busy afternoon at all. There were only 4 groups in total in the whole place.\n\nWe waited about 10 minutes before a young lady came over and we showed her our voucher and told her what we wanted. THEY HAD NO CHICKEN AND NO STEAK! It was not okay because my friend only eats chicken. Anyway we adjusted and I got a burger and she got French toast.\n\nWe waited 45 mins for our food....did I mention it was not busy. The pastry basket was very sad, and no one checked on us after we got the mimosas. A gentle man came over to say sorry there was no chicken 2 mins before the food came out. The burger was salty, I ate it because I was hungry. My friend said her French toast was good.\n\nWe waited long in general for everything, the food, the bill, the service. Really had to rethink the tipping but she did leave a tip anyway.",

Neither of us was able to eat the noodles. The vegetables were ok. Our child had chicken fried rice. He could not eat his food either. I told two members of the staff that we could not eat the food and definitely we did not want to take it with us. They did not care.\nAs soon as we paid, they started emptying the table although we still had our drinks. While I used the bathroom, they actually took my daughter's drink from her and asked her and the child to leave the table.\nAdvice: do not pay before you are definitely ready to leave immediately.

We ordered pan fried dumplings, tofu skin with cedar sauce, mixed sea food with cedar sauce in taro bowl, eggplant in spicy laksa sauce, Buddha’s delight pan fried noodles, and Fujian fried rice.\n\nEverything was so delicious. I love their cedar sauce. It goes so well with everything, and it’s so fragrant and savory.\n\nMy favorite dish was the mixed seafood with cedar sauce in taro bowl. It has been my no. 1 for a long time. I have to get it whenever I’m here. I also love the Buddha’s delight pan fried noodles. The crunchy noodles with slightly gluey sauce were just perfect. Especially when the noodles were mixed with the sauce and got a bit saggy, it was the most delightful texture. The braised tofu skin with cedar sauce was also very good. I especially love the cabbage they put in the bottom of the plate. It absorbs the flavor and with the sweetness of its own.\n\nIt was my first time trying their Fujian fried rice. The idea was very similar to the Buddha’s delight pan fried noodles, but replaced the noodles with fried rice. I love the bits of the ham in the sauce.\n\nEverything was simply delicious, but just like almost all Chinese food, it’s a bit greasy. Good thing was they had some tea to go with it. The servers were also pretty pleasant and friendly.",

The octopus chorizo and spiced duck breast were even more delicious; from the first mouthwatering wafts when the dishes are placed on the table to the wonderful blend of flavors, everything delivered perfectly. When you ask for the bill, it comes with a small coconut dessert that’s warm and chewy. I savored every bite of it and still think about it now.\n\nBeginning to end everything delivered!

Nothing extraordinarily groundbreaking but it's an interesting refreshing twist to try. Same goes to the humble fan taun. What my friend and I mutually agreed is absolutely delicious is the seasonal nian gao fig pastry. Nian gao batter, layered with creamy custard, fig jam and topped with smooth mascoropone cream and figs - WOW. You don't have to be a sweet tooth to enjoy this, you just need to love yourself enough to treat yourself with this. Kudos to the pastry chef.\n\nThe drinks itself was fine but I felt the food does the storytelling here. I'd revisit to give the menu another shot out of curiosity.

The space has this perfect balance of industrial and modern décor exposed brick, soft lighting, and elegant touches that make it feel both stylish and welcoming. It’s one of those restaurants where you notice the details right away, from the furniture to the way the dishes are plated.\nI stopped in for their lunch special, which I thought was a great deal. The prices are fairly affordable considering the quality and the portions the servings are actually quite large, so you definitely won’t leave hungry. I ordered the chili fish, and it was excellent flavorful, fresh, and just the right level of spice. The food came out quickly, which I really appreciated during lunch hours.\nI also tried the egg and scallion stuffed pancake, which ended up being one of my favorite parts of the meal. It’s crispy, savory, and full of flavor the kind of dish that makes you want to come back just for that. Overall, Birds of a Feather is a great place for a relaxed but elevated meal in Williamsburg. Highly recommend checking it out, especially for lunch.",

Among them birds of a feather, a Chinese-inspired cuisine of highest quality. The interior is cool with multiple individual tables and a major communal table in the center. The atmosphere is hectic but the staff remain calm and friendly. The food was outstanding with too many choices untested and requiring us to return in the future.\n\n(Originally posted by me on Yelp)",

    "text": "5-Star Review for Birds of a Feather (Williamsburg, Brooklyn)\nBirds of a Feather – A True Gem for Foodies and Friend Hangouts!\nIf you're looking for that perfect spot where incredible food meets unbeatable vibes, Birds of a Feather in Williamsburg is your answer. This Sichuan-inspired Chinese restaurant, born from the genius minds behind Michelin-starred Cafe China, nails the balance of authentic flavors and chill atmosphere every time.\nI've made it a ritual to come here with my crew – it's hands-down my top go-to place for group hangs. The space feels warm and inviting, with those subtle nods to Chengdu's laid-back greenery that make you forget you're in the heart of Brooklyn. Whether we're splitting plates after a long week or celebrating a birthday, the energy just flows – spacious tables, dim lighting, and that effortless cool factor that keeps conversations going all night.\nBut let's talk food, because oh man, it's on another level. Top-tier doesn't even cover it – every dish is a flavor explosion. The Dan Dan noodles? Silky, spicy, and nutty perfection that had us all fighting for the last bite. We couldn't resist the cumin lamb skewers (smoky, tender, and addictive) or the mapo tofu, which brings just the right heat without overwhelming. Portions are generous for sharing, and the cocktails (shoutout to the yuzu margarita) cut through the spice like a dream. Service is spot-on too – attentive but not hovering, which lets you focus on the good times.\nPrice-wise, it's a steal for the quality – expect around $50-70 per person with drinks, and you'll leave stuffed and smiling. If you love bold, authentic eats in a spot that's as fun for friends as it is delicious, do yourself a favor and book a table. Birds of a Feather isn't just a meal; it's a vibe. Can't wait to go back! 🌶️🍜 5/5 stars.",

The portions are large at this restaurant. The quality doesn't miss no matter if I dine in or order delivery.\nChungking chicken comes with crunchy small chicken bites, loaded with chillies, packed with flavors and that mouth numbing spiciness. Kung pao chicken is tender, velvety texture. Spicy fish filled is my favorite dish; it's comes with small fried fish fillers, crunchy, perfect moisture level with that signature spiciness of szechuan chilies. Mapo tofu is also one of the must try dish, hot tofu on a bed of spicy ground pork sauce. It's perfect for any dinner meal. Spicy cumin lamb is absolutely the most tender and flavorful lamb I have had in a long time. Tea smoked duck offers juicy smoked duck slices, pairs well with buns and sauce.\nThe restaurant can get really crowded during dinner time. It is suggested to get a reservation ahead of time or to stop by at odd hours to avoid waiting in line.\nOverall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves to enjoy Chinese cuisine or just loves to incorporate chilies in their meals.",

Music was perfect, playing all my favorites. Waitress was AWESOME and super helpful. We got espresso martinis which came out quick and green beans and wontons to start. Green beans turned out to be our fav fish and were delicious with some fried bread on top. Great flavor. Wontons were good too and had a curry/Indian flavor. I thought they could have been hotter (temp and spice level), but we enjoyed them. we also got the noodles. I personally don't like the rolled noodles and I thought the flavor was weird.

I will say that the shrimp with the candied walnuts were really good and the long beans were also pretty good. I ordered the mussels with the shoestring fries and when it came out, it had pieces of what looked like some kind of pork on top so I asked the server is that pork? and they said yes and I said oh no I can’t eat that so they brought it back and gave me the menu to pick something else, and I asked if I could have the same thing but with no pork and they said they couldn’t do that because it was in the broth so when I looked at the menu again, I realized it mentioned nowhere that there was pork in there, which is kind of annoying because if it wasn’t directly on top, I would’ve never known it was in the broth. I heard this place is extremely popular and I don’t know I’ve had much better food for lower prices and just better food in general. I also was not a fan of the flounder at all.

The texture of the rice noodles was nice though, and i really liked the flavor of the dried shrimp.\n\nThe bkrib.. It was good. I really liked the fluffinesses and the flavor of the bread, the sauce on the meat, and it was cooked okay. Maybe a bit overcooked. The onions and pickles provided a nice contrast. Not show stopping though. This was also too salty.\n\nThe half chicken was pretty good as well. The broth was my favorite part. The flavor and cook on the chicken was good, but the rice didn’t really make any sense. It was yummy, but it felt as though the rice and the chicken were two completely separate dishes. The chicken was also too salty.\n\nI would say the food is pretty good, maybe not worth the price, and my  main issue is the overall saltiness of the dishes.

Mozz and bread is a large portion but absolutely worth trying. Cheese was soft and flavorful and bread was thick and crusty.   Little gem salad as pretty to look at as it was to eat.   Grilled artichoke, I probably could have eaten 5.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Bagna Cauda was a miss for us. The anchovy dip was overpowering and I think I just didn’t understand the dish.  We tried the agnolotti based on our server’s recommendation and so glad we did.  Soft creamy pillows of deliciousness. Spaghetti also delicious, pasta was al dente with texture from the nuts.   Escarole was another recommended dish and it was very good and a nice side. The lamb steak was our other miss. It was cooked well but if I didn’t know I was eating lamb I would have thought it was a bland steak.  It had no gamey lamb flavor.  We didn’t know but will try next time that there is an off the menu steak and potato dish you can order. It looked and smelled amazing.  This restaurant serves unpretentious delicious food, can’t wait to return and try more options.",

    "text": "I’ve been ordering delivery from Tito Rad’s for years (ever since I moved to Forest Hills four years ago) and it’s hands down the closest thing to homemade Filipino food I’ve ever had. I’ve been around Filipinos all my life, and Tito Rad's dishes always bring that authentic, comforting flavor that feels like it came straight from an auntie's kitchen.\n\nI’ve only had the chance to dine in once when I happened to be running an errand right across the street. The food fresh from the kitchen was even better... hot, perfectly seasoned, and clearly made with care.\n\nYesterday, for Filipino American History Month, my office facilities coordinator (based in San Francisco) provided our NYC team with lunch from Tito Rad’s... delivered to our Manhattan office near Bryant Park. I had no idea they delivered that far! If I’d known, I would’ve been ordering for my coworkers years ago.\n\nEverything was a hit... Pritong Lumpia, Pancit Bihon, Adobo Fried Rice, Beef Steak, Chicken BBQ Skewers, Lechon Kawali, and Turon. Every dish disappeared fast and now my coworkers want to make Tito Rad’s one of our go-to team lunches.\n\nTo top it off, someone from the restaurant even called afterward to check in and make sure everything went well (sorry I missed the call). That thoughtful touch really says a lot about how much they care about their customers.\n\nIf you’re looking for authentic, delicious Filipino food, Tito Rad’s is the place to go. And if you need catering or delivery (even to Manhattan), that’s just the cherry on top!",

I should’ve went with more people so I could order more food, but we went with “basics” - tapsilog, tocilog, and longsilog. I didn’t even get to order lechon! Anyway, I got ukoy to try as an appetizer, and ginataang langka (never tried this before but I know I like jack fruit) and ginataang calabasa. I like the calabasa. I ordered it with garlic fried rice to eat. The ginataang langka was … different. I’ll stick to it being a fruit that belongs in dessert or turon. The tapa was sweet, which I wasn’t a fan of but really, it’s your preference. Everything else was good. The hot calamansi was so warm in my stomach. It felt nice. The halo halo was good too. Big portion in a big bowl so I’m not struggling to eat it from a drinking cup. The ukoy was different for me too. I don’t like bean sprouts but this was fried and it wasn’t bad. Bonus: the waitress told me their ube ice cream is home made. Overall, I would revisit with a larger group. I would advise calling to make a reservation. I waited an hour to be seated. The staff was extremely kind though. They did check on us from time to time while waiting and updated us when our table would be ready. Very family-oriented.",

    "text": "We decided to go here as a central meeting point for folks coming from Jersey and Long Island. I had been to a Japanese BBQ place where you cook your own food, this was a little different. The place is spacious and brightly lit as the sitting areas need to be spaced out(cooking areas and smoke hoods), you sat on stools that you can store your items in. You chose the type of meat selection from 3 choices. The whole table must choose the same menu course. You are on a timer but we weren't affected. There are many selections, so make sure to try all of them at least once. The tray can cook 2 portions at a time and once it gets cooking 4-5 adults will having trouble keeping up, but we have it our all. The food was delicious, they cook it all for you. Pork, beef was best we didn't try the chicken. The Soju was awesome; pomegranate, lychee and blueberry... All very tasty. Make sure to get lettuce and rice. The salad was also very tasty. Just be careful and observant; when the server pulled back from placing meat on the cooking tray, some of the meat juice fell on the salad. We set that salad aside immediately. I definitely want to come back the seats were ok, but I dunno how long we can sit on those seats. Price was reasonable. Definitely go here and check it out.",

The staff seemed super authentic Nepali too, both in how they talked and acted, which was a nice touch.\n\nFood was good! I’d say go for the beef (yes they are halal) options if you’re into meat — the chicken momos were okay but had more veggies than chicken. Loved the Thai Soup Momo (gave off a bit of a butter chicken vibe) and of course, the Chilli Momos are always a win.\n\nBonus points for the super clean washrooms — seriously, top-notch. Overall, I’d give it an 8.5/10. Great spot, just a little pricey for students.",

The restaurant was very clean and the staff was pretty attentive as it was midweek and it wasn't too busy.\nI ordered the Lunch Special Chicken Yeero pita sandwich with a Mesculan salad and some of their famous SVL sauce.\nThe chicken was perfectly seasoned,  super moist, and plentiful.  It was layered with french fries, tomatoes, and fresh red onions all on a fresh off the grill pita bread.\nThe mesclun \"side salad\" was also super fresh and well proportioned with red and yellow peppers, petite cucumbers and balsamic vinegar\nOverall I had a great experience at SVL and will definitely come back as I want to try the chicken sticks and rice next.\nAlso this french fries were seriously seriously good and well seasoned.\nCan't wait to visit again.",

I had the Madrid Strew (Chickpeas and Tripe with Chorizo), my Mom had Mussels, Scampi style and our friend had Fried Calamari.  We were all very happy with our appetizers.  Then for our entrées, we all had Merluza which in English is Hake.  We each had it in a different preparation.  There was grilled, stewed and breaded.  Mine was Grilled and it came with vegetables and a choice of a side.  I chose Boiled Potatoes.  My Mom chose to have it in Stew which is served in sauce and with Potatoes and our friend chose the Breaded version with a choice of a side.  She had the French Fries.  We were all happy with the preparation we chose.  The servings were large.  We all took food home.  We all had Flan for dessert and it was very good.  My Mom had Wine, our friend had Sangria and I had Estrella, a beer from Spain.  The prices are very good here.  The service is excellent. We came in the afternoon but in the evenings they have entertainment.  I don't know if it's every evening or only on certain evenings.  I have to look into that.  The space reminds me of a small scale Supper Club.  There is also a area off to the side with a Bar, t.v.'s and seats.  We will definitely go back, maybe when they have a show.  I also have to say,  we've been to Spain on several occasions and the food here is as good and even better than in some Restaurants in Spain.  Forgot to mention that we each got a Bailey's, on the house.  It's very rare for restaurants to do that nowadays.",

You can tell that this place cares about their customers because when I walked in, I was greeted by the cashier with a big smile and positive attitude. I couldn’t decide if I want a heavy meal or something light like wings but then the person at the front helped me out saying I should try their mini classic combo. I took his advice and tried it and when I tell you this burger was really amazing I truly mean it. Also it took less than 15 min for my food to be ready and they make everything fresh.

A thin inedible, old, freezer burned patty that broke down like stale bread in your mouth. The most upsetting aspect of this is that the patties are clearly not being stored properly but it’s obvious they don’t care enough about what the customers eat to provide better quality food. If turkey patties are unpopular, take them off the menu rather than give your customers stale items that could potentially cause food poisoning!!!!!!!!!!",

I ordered the Wonton and Braised Beef noodles, Pork Ribs Claypot rice, and Choy Sum(Vegetables). Wonton was big with shrimp and pork in it, you can taste that it's the freshly made and not frozen ones. Braised Beef was tender and there were many pieces in it. Noodles are just like the wonton noodles in Hong Kong, cooked great, a bit chewy. The clay pot rice was made to order and came burning hot after cooking it over the fire. Can’t wait to come back and try more dishes.",

    "text": "Long overdue review. I discovered Moon Kee soon after they opened 2 yrs ago.  My  BFF lives on 103rd so it's just 2 blocks away. I can't believe there is an **authentic** Canto restaurant up here!  I grew up in LA, lived in NY for 6 yrs and now in No CA.  Yes I'm an ABC, but my husband was born in HK and I know good authentic Chinese food. They even have BBQ meat hanging in the windows and people yelling in Cantonese to each other, haha.  Sign of authenticity in a dim sum place.  The only \"non-authentic\" thing? It's very very clean, no food stains on the chairs or tables but I haven't seen the bathrooms  (I know I'm risking offending some ppl on here...it's a *joke*).  There are always lots of Chinese ppl in here too.\n\nI was hungry after flying in from CA and why spend $7 on a ham and cheese croissant heated in a microwave when you can have 3 gao choi gao (shrimp and chive dumpling) cooked fresh for the same price? Look at the size of the shrimp!  And you can sit in a clean booth with a/c (it's 90 deg outside). They're really nice and weren't upset that I just ordered $7 worth of food.  Very good service.\n\nI've been here ~7 times and everything has been excellent. The big test for me in any dim sum place is the wu gok (taro dumpling). Many reputable places have other excellent dishes but their wu gok tastes of ammonia meaning old taro.  Or they're really oily.  NOT here - they're crisp, made of fresh taro, and not oily at all.  The dan tats (egg tarts) are perfect- flaky crisp dough. They just told me they are hand made here and the chef has over 30 yrs experience making dim sum.\n\nI told my friend about this place and now her family gets food from here all the time.\n\nSomeone mentioned the prices- ummm look at where they are.  And it's not more than what we spend in SF and some places in NY Chinatown.",

They all looked like it was either cooked the day before or in the morning. Everything looked dry and not so appetizing. Anyhow I still wanted to give it a try. This Tehri is tasteless, super bland, what’s even more disappointing is that it has almost no meat and all of it is just rice. I got tehri from Khalil biriyani house as well just to compare. Although it wasn’t that great either but it was way better. It was flavorful and had meat in every bite. Bhai taka diye kine ebhabe manush ke dhoka dewar kono mane ami dekhi na.

    "text": "“This post reflects my personal experience as a paying customer in a public-facing restaurant setting, supported by receipts and photos, it is intended to let the owners know about their service/employee only, not to attack anyone personally.”\n\nThis review is directed to the owner or management of Bronx Al Aqsa Restaurant. If you cannot manage your online orders properly, then please stop taking them. Your two employees outright denied my order. Even after I stood inside the restaurant, they did not respond. When I asked if they were busy, they said “we’re not free” while they were just sitting and chatting.\n\nMy pickup time was 9:30 pm, yet they claimed they never received my order. I reminded them that I had placed the order nearly 1 to 1.5 hours earlier and asked why my food was still not ready. At this point, the employee wearing a cap, instead of speaking politely, became extremely rude. He said, “We don’t know about online order issues, call the owner.” I asked him to call the supervisor, but he repeated, “It’s your need, not mine, so I won’t call.”\n\nIf your restaurant hires people without training them in customer service, this is the result. If you cannot manage online orders or do not have skilled staff for it, you should not be advertising online orders on Facebook.\n\nI have been a regular customer of your grocery and restaurant for the past four years. Starting today, I will boycott your business. I know my leaving alone won’t harm your business, but I am writing this so you are aware of how your employees behave. If you think keeping my $22 makes you wealthy, then so be it. I often give to the homeless; today I’ll consider you as one of them. May GOD bring you in front of me on the Day of Judgment—that is my prayer.\n\nEdit: This guy had the audacity to reach me on my social media from a fake profile and asked me to remove his photo or else he'll file a lawsuit. My guy thinks that he can't be filmed or photographed while he's working at a publicly open restaurant, he should learn the law. First of all he's rude and their owner is also encouraging these kind of money grabbing things and then they have this much courage of playing a victim card while he's treating me like that.",

They always give some green chilies, some lettuce, and a quarter of a lemon. Maybe some onions and carrots. The restaurant has little to no decor. They have campfire sounds playing on the speakers.

But the waitress brought just one plate, as usual we have asked for couple more plates then she brought four plates. Okay!!  We asked for extra cups so that we can try their borhani which usually comes in a bottle, then she literally brought 6 cups for 12 people. None of the waiters has any idea of the service and their food.  Okay now let’s talk about their food, The pictures of Salad will talk for me, I will not even try to explain.

You are in a quiet garden in the center of the city. I ordered a hamburger. It was the worst hamburger I have ever eaten in New York. I mean, a hamburger you eat at McDonald's is probably much better. I had a bad experience in this regard as well. But it is definitely a place where you can come with your friends, have a drink and sit. The bar looks very strong but I haven't tried anything. I only had a bad experience with the food. But still\nThanx ❤️‍🔥🤘🏻",

They have a system where you pay Zelle and then you pick up your food close to old school as you’re going to get you can place the order over the phone everything was very convenient. Not sure what happened tonight to the woman taking the order, but she was rude and condescending after I called for update on when the delivery was coming.  I didn’t appreciate that since I have spent over it $180 at this place over the past few months not to mention, I had my Job used them for a large lunch that we had for concert that we were producing In Flushing meadows Park I was shocked lost my appetite for my dinner. I sent My Son to go pick it up instead of me going there in person because I’m pretty sure I would’ve told her exactly what I’m writing here today in this review of Pekin Empire. her out, I was disappointed in her behavior as a business owner. That’s not how you talk to customers if you’re busy to say hey I apologize we’re busy but to tell your customer that you’re not the only customer rudely unacceptable, especially since we live in Flushing and there’s so many choices of food to choose from they just lost a customer",

The Fried Calamari was crispy and perfectly seasoned, the Traditional Pizza had a wonderfully balanced flavor, and both the Fettuccine Alfredo and Baked Ziti were rich, creamy, and comforting. The Chicken Parmesan was also outstanding—crispy on the outside and tender inside with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. Dessert was fun and delicious... S'mores Pizza!\n\nOur servers, Dean and Cynthia, were attentive, friendly, and made us feel right at home. The ambiance was charming and cozy, creating the perfect setting for a relaxed meal. The location is great, and to top it off, parking was easy and convenient. Highly recommend for anyone looking for great Italian food and warm hospitality!",

It is essentially cut up flatbread with their garlicky flavor and I couldn't stop eating it!! We got our food after a fairly long wait but the food was solid. However, there are definitely places that would have better food for a similar price. After getting the bill, I saw that I was charged extra for the side of pasta that comes with their entree. I was not informed prior to ordering that there was an extra charge for certain sides given that the menu states \"All entrees come with a side pasta, vegetable or potato croquettes.\" The word \"come\" means it is complementary and therefore not an additional charge. The menu should be more clear with the costs. Since the charge wasn't too much I wasn't too mad.\n\nPatsy has a really good pizza deal which is two 16\" traditional pizza for $20!! This is ONLY for takeout orders and on Tuesday to Thursdays. There pizzas are one of the BESTT I've ever had!! It is thin and crispy and they have the perfect balance between the sauce and the cheese so that neither is too overpowering. I also love their brick oven gives the pizza an uneven char on the cheese and the crust. You should definitely come to Patsy's to get this deal!\n\nOverall Rating is a 4.3/5",

Everything was delicious and well-balanced. The potato pancakes were finely grated, giving them that perfect classic flavor — especially good with the sour cream sauce. The cabbage roll was juicy, and the cabbage itself was tender and slightly sweet — cooked to perfection.\n\nBefore the meal, they served two slices of bread with butter — the butter was rich and flavorful. For dessert, I had three cheese-filled crepes (nalysnyky) — huge, creamy, and served with a refreshing lemon sauce. I could only finish one and took the rest to go.\n\nThe service was quick and attentive, the food was fresh, and presentation neat. The total bill came to $34 — a great value for such quality. I’ll definitely be back!",

It was served with a mushroom sauce that complimented the comfortable savory flavor of the meat filling.\nThe breaded pork chop was almost fork-tender and had a pleasant savory flavor.\nBoth plates came with a vegetable and potato option.

The restaurant isn’t flashy, but it was bustling with locals even on a Thursday night, which felt like a good sign.\n\nThe server was friendly and helpful, offering suggestions for a first-timer like me. I went with her recommendation, the Polish platter, which included a hearty spread: one golabek, one kielbasa with onions and sauerkraut, two pierogi, a potato pancake, and a bowl of soup. The soup was a nice surprise—different but delicious. The meal came out simply plated, not fancy, but everything tasted fresh and comforting. The pierogi were my favorite, and the kielbasa was flavorful. The golabek was good, though I wasn’t a huge fan of their sauce.\n\nOverall, it was a solid, authentic Polish meal with attentive service. A good spot to try traditional dishes, though I probably wouldn’t go back again.",

    "text": "I’ve been here a handful of times - it’s deliciously well-priced authentic Japanese food (with a very nice izakaya vibe), and the space is large enough that I have never had to wait for a table.\n\nThe menu is pretty long (can be a bit difficult à la decision paralysis) and they have a (cute handwritten) menu of specials, so I must admit I haven’t tried most of their dishes (nor any of their drinks). But what I have gotten has consistently been fantastic - some highlights include:\n\n- Oroshi tonkatsu set: the katsu is so yummy with a wonderful texture (fried to a good balance of not being too oily or soggy). The whole set comes with a generous amount of food (soup, salad as well), and specifically I just love the taste of oroshi in the light dashi broth. I’ve also had the curry katsu before - the curry itself was pretty good, nothing too notable to point out, and the katsu was similarly delicious.\n\n- Sukiyaki donburi was a particular favourite. The sweet flavour went with the tender sliced beef so nicely, and it came with a good assortment of tofu, veggies, and egg for a very well balanced dish. Yakiniku don was yummy too - not too salty, beef savoury and well-cooked, and the rice/sauce combo complemented everything nicely.\n\nI’ve had the chicken karaage as an appetiser a few times before, and it was a bit inconsistent each time (sometimes a bit soggy breading / not tender meat). I feel like it’s not really worth the price (especially compared to the cost most of the main dishes on the menu).\n\nIndeed, overall the price point is very solid here - esp for the neighbourhood. Even though I read some reviews suggesting that they are a no-tip restaurant, I fear this may no longer be the case, sigh. Would love to come back again soon!",

The sound of a cocktail lounge with small bites is really good but they were playing the most random songs that did not add to the ambiance at all. If i am going to eat and drink on a crammed table the ambiance can make up for it but it was not the case. The only food item worth the money is probably the Short Rib Sliders. Pass on the croquettes and pigs in a blanket, they only come with a couple of them and leave you wanting more. Lastly the cocktails. They sounds really interesting and tasteful but when you drink it, its very lacklustre. The sweet ones are too sweet and the savoury ones are not savoury enough. I really was disappointed unfortunately. The waiters tried their best to recommend drinks i would like but the menu did not allow me to be satisfied at all.",

However, there was a lady who approached me and asked me to surrender my water bottle that wasn't opened. I don't know her name, but I can say she looks like a distressed Margot Kidder. She told me when I left. I can ask for my water bottle back and I told her I may forget. But she was persistent and insisted on the water bottle until my fiancé took the water bottle, opened it and poured it into his cup of water. I don't know what the problem was, but she totally ruined my entire experience at this restaurant and that's what prompted me to close out my visit. If a customer is sitting at a table with a closed bottled water, they shouldn't have to be pestered to surrender it.",

Ordered the Lay rolls, which was the only dish that was not satisfactory. They were dry and had what I believed to be insufficient filling. The brief taste of the filling was quite good however. Ordered the wings for an appetizer. They were crispy, cooked perfectly and the saucy was sweet and delicious. We had the red snapper for an entree and it was also perfect. The fish was whole cooked and perfectly fresh. Snapper is my favorite and this was soooo delicious. It was enough for two to share. We ordered a plate of rice - the pineapple which was equally delicious and paired wonderfully with the fish. I would definitely return. I live in the area and this a great local spot!!! Yummy 😋",

The stewed beef in curry was so soft and was excellent when paired with the rice. The last dish, Pla Tod Samun Prai which is a fried branzino with lots of herbs and spices. It was super soft and flaky and the herbs, onions and garlic and other items went so well with it. Probably one of our favorite dishes of the night.\n\nThe staff was super nice and very attentive.

From the moment I stepped through its modern, chic entrance, I knew I was in for something special. The attention to detail, both in the ambiance and the service, was pristine and thoughtful.\n\nWe were warmly welcomed by Catherine, our server for the evening, whose grace and professionalism, along with the attentive support of the entire team, made the night flow effortlessly. Each course was served with impeccable timing, and dishes were changed seamlessly between courses, every gesture contributing to the seamless dining experience.\n\nI opted for the Chef’s Tasting Menu, a seven-course exploration that was nothing short of extraordinary. The kitchen kindly and impressively accommodated my dietary restrictions (no dairy or shellfish), without compromising on creativity or flavor. Every plate was a work of art, visually stunning and masterfully composed with bold, yet balanced Nordic flavors.\n\nThe starters included a delicate fluke with cucumber, a beautifully presented cod with white asparagus, caviar, and apple, each dish showcasing refreshing elements with a rich complexity of flavor.\n\nThe entrees featured a vibrant salmon with Meyer lemon, a perfectly cooked Chilean sea bass with turnip, and a standout lamb with morel mushrooms. The fish was impeccably fresh and cooked to perfection, highlighting the natural taste of the sea, while the lamb served medium, was tender, herbaceous, and deeply satisfying.\n\nDessert was a lovely finale: a luscious chocolate mousse paired with strawberry, a sweet and elegant ending to an evening of pure culinary delight.\n\nAquavit is not only a restaurant, it’s an experience. A beautifully orchestrated blend of Nordic innovation, seasonal freshness, and flawless execution, it absolutely deserves every accolade and star it has received. A must-visit for any gourmand seeking something unique and memorable in New York City.",

    "text": "Aquavit was my first 2 Michelin Star dining experience. Having had the privilege of dining at a handful of 1 Star restaurants before for lunch and dinner (like Le Pavillon, one of Daniel Boulud's restaurants in NY), I wanted to see what, if any, discernible difference there was between the two.\n\nThe thing I truly appreciate about Aquavit is its lack of pretentiousness and inviting model. I snagged a day-of 5:30pm reservation for 1 person in the bar area (a la carte menu only) at a gorgeous 2 Michelin Star fine dining restaurant and spent *under $100* for a 3-course meal WITH an aquavit flight. Incredible! They even take walk-ins at the bar if you're feeling the itch for excellent Scandinavian cuisine one night.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, I was greeted and my coat was checked by the woman at the front of house. To my surprise, she guided me to a booth table in the bar room (I was assuming I'd just be relegated to a high chair at the bar, but those are just for walk-ins).\n\nMy waiter quickly introduced himself, and there was a brief awkward moment when he put a second menu down and asked if I'd like to wait for my guest. I made a reservation for one and was dining alone, so I had to tell him it was just myself 😂 Not a huge deal at all, but a more sensitive guest might not have appreciated the assumption.\n\nHe then asked for my water preference (still and sparkling are both complimentary) and a second waiter quickly filled my glass from behind once I indicated my preference. I ordered the Nordic Breads (sourdough & Danish rye), a flight of 3 aquavits (Fig & Cardamom, Bränneri, and Høvding) and the Swedish Meatballs.\n\nThe surprise stars of these was the Danish rye and the Fig and Høvding aquavits. The rye was arguably the best bread I've ever had (and I'm not a lover of hard seeded loafs), and the complex depth of flavor present in the drinks was a pleasure to experience.\n\nThe meatballs were nothing to sniff at, though. They certainly will go down as the best meatballs I've ever had, and the dish as a whole was beautifully balanced. The meatballs' texture was perfect, the pommes puree was luscious, the lingonberry provided a bright sweetness, and the house-made shaved cucumber pickles added a much-needed crunch and acidity.\n\nAfter much deliberation and a recommendation from my waiter, I opted for the Apple Vacherin dessert as my final course. When it came out, it was accompanied by a small birthday Princess Cake, as I was having this dinner as a birthday celebration. It was a very cute moment, as the diners next to me, seeing I was alone at the table with my small birthday cake, all wished me a happy birthday 😊\n\nBoth desserts were excellent, but the Apple Vacherin was truly sublime. Each element gave way to a depth of flavor I wasn't expecting. The apples were tart and crisp which contrasted beautifully with the light vanilla creme fraiche. It was followed on the palate by the crunch of the tarragon-infused meringue, and the toasted sunflower seeds at the bottom laid dormant in your mouth until the very end when they gave a gorgeous kettle corn note to round out the meal.\n\nTruly excellent experience from start to finish. I look forward to coming back in the dining room and trying out the tasting menu, especially the famous bird's nest dish which was not present on the a la carte menu.",

The ambient music established a super serene atmosphere, and I was looking forward to dining. The dining experience itself was phenomenal. The staff was incredibly polite and accommodating for dietary restrictions of any kind. The food was incredibly creative. Some dishes were innovative, while some were meant to be cozy and nostalgic. Every dish performed how it was meant to. We were each given a gift: a complimentary container of the restaurant’s smoked sea salt along with the day’s menu. I’m excited to use this sea salt in my own dishes, and I hope to return soon.",

    "text": "Honestly, I've dined at Aquavit over 5 times now, having making the trek from Eastern Long Island to Manhattan just to come here.\n\nThis place is world class. From the relaxing ambiance, the vibe, the serenity, and the friendliness of all the staff. The food is simply divine.\n\nEverything about the dishes presented as careful thought and execution. And it shows. I've had the Chef's tasting menu on my first visit, and enjoy the Bar menu consistently there-after.\n\nLast night I had a remarkable Steak Tartare, Chilled Corn soup, and my date had the pancake shrimp skagen. As usual, world class food. For the seconds, we enjoyed the Atlantic cod and Kroppkakor. Again, everything outstanding.\n\nThe steak tartare should remain on the offering all year round, in my opinion!\n\nDessert I had the Swedish Pancake Huckleberry with the heavenly vanilla whipped cream. On previous visits, I had a wonderful Chilean Sea bass burger.\n\nAquavit is a place that feels like home and I hope they never change it. For the price point, its insane value and this cannot be denied. I'm shocked they do not have a 3rd Michelin Star.\n\nI've attached photos from my multiple meals here, most recent from last night. My compliments to the entire Aquavit team for making this such a fantastic experience, every time.\n\nDesmond Bhimull, MD",

We started the meal with an Amuse of Elk Tartare which definitely amused the palate and got us ready for the whole experience. We shared a bottle of Timorasso which was perfect with many of the light dishes we enjoyed in the Chef's Tasting. The kitchen is in full sight with a glass wall and we enjoyed seeing them at work. We opted to add the Caviar supplement which was a nice touch. Service was top notch. Highly recommend.",

The gazpacho was perfectly executed, nice acidity light flavorful. I had the chicken Parmesan with the Jr. portion of pasta. The mini dollop of ricotta was a nice touch although I definitely had issues with the portion size. The chicken itself was nicely seasoned, but wasn’t exactly the most tender piece of chicken I’ve ever had in a restaurant in a Parmesan.\nWe enjoyed the fries, those were well dine and the aioli was tasty.\nThe cocktails we had were not memorable in either presentation or taste and thus no pics of the drinks.  The environment was loud  and it was busy and the wait staff seemed to be having a low energy day. It is a fairly large restaurant with mezzanine seating. Overall, It was ok.

I did have to Google what each curry was but I knew having had Thai before that curries are my best option.  We had the Massman and the Panang curries; both are very similar in taste.  The one negative here is the mens room - very run down and scary.  I have to rate low just on that alone.  Please do a deep clean!",

The tables where we sat were for enough away that it felt separate from the bar area, though. Also of note, bathrooms were very clean, which says a lot.\nOur waitress was friendly and attentive. She took our order promptly and the appetizers (mozzarella sticks and soup) came out quickly. The entrees arrived hot and as we asked for them.\nLast, but definitely not least, the food was awesome! The mozzarella sticks were 6 to an order (I love when it's an even number) and I really loved the marinara sauce. The Buffalo chicken chowder was so good! A little bit of heat, lots of chicken and veggies, and just thick enough.\nWe ordered the chicken tenders, which had a light and crunchy beer batter coating. If the batter is the same, I can't wait to try the fried fish next. We also tried the Cowboy burger. It came out medium well as we had asked and had just the right amount of bbq (I hate when they pour it on and soak the bun). Fries were good too.\nOverall, a pleasant experience all around and we will be back to try other items too. You should stop by yourself and give it a try.",

The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with just the right mix of rustic and elegant.\n\nThe service was warm and attentive without being rushed, and the staff made me feel very welcome. It does get lively during peak hours, but it adds to the authentic, bustling Italian vibe. Prices are fair for the quality, and portions are generous enough to share.\n\nDefinitely a place I would return to – whether for a date night, dinner with friends, or simply to enjoy some great Italian comfort food in Manhattan. Highly recommend!",

Personally, I prefer the frozen as they have the perfect consistency. I ordered the frozen coconut (which is out of this world) and my friend got the frozen blood orange marg which was also incredible. My one little critique is that what is labeled on the menu as a “quesadilla” is indeed NOT at all a quesadilla. It’s literally a soft taco with little to no cheese, but I will give them this- they are delicious. The chorizo is a big hit here and is full of flavor, but please just add more cheese!!! That’s the entire point of a (quesa)dilla, LOL. The service is great here and the atmosphere is relaxed, but it’s also very fun with the festive decor and upbeat tunes in the background.",

After I took a small sampler plate, the waiter came over and told me they were closing the buffet soon and that I should take whatever I wanted before they put it away. I asked why he hadn’t mentioned that before I sat down, and he just looked at me and walked off.\n\nI took some food, but it was cold. I asked for a container to take it home, and they refused. When I asked to speak with the manager, they said he was busy on the phone. I waited while he stood in the corner talking in Hindi and laughing—clearly aware of me standing there. I called out to him three times. After 20 minutes, he finally came over and told me there’s no takeout allowed for the buffet. He also claimed to be one of the owners.\n\nI explained what had happened, and instead of apologizing, he accused me of threatening the waiter with a negative review—which I hadn’t done. Then, once he realized I had been there before, he brought me a container. But at that point, I told him I no longer wanted the food. I didn’t want to eat it later and feel all the stress and disrespect all over again.\n\nJust to be clear: I make over half a million dollars a year.

We went for Saturday lunch, and overall, the experience was enjoyable.\n\nWe started with the potato pancakes, which we really liked. They were served with both applesauce and sour cream — my first time trying that combination. The applesauce was an interesting (and surprisingly tasty) pairing.\n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the Sauerbraten. The sauce it came with was described as sweet and sour, but I found it mostly sweet — which worked well for me. The beef was a little on the dry side, though I’m not sure if that’s typical for the dish. It came with a potato dumpling that was more like a scoop of mashed potatoes, and a side of red cabbage that had a pleasantly sweet flavor — not what I expected, but I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe wifey ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and absolutely loved it. It came with a small serving of lingonberries, home fries, and the same red cabbage that I had.\n\nOverall, we both enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu.",

Warm, helpful, professional service; our waiter let us taste an unfamiliar wine which we loved and wound up ordering. Food was delicious - I had the meatball sandwich (not sure if only avail at lunch): tender, flavorful meatballs, excellent bright sauce and not too much bread, with a peppery arugula salad on the side. Companions were very happy with their food as well. Really good place, will definitely return.",

I’m always trying to find a good Indian take out and hate taking risks to be disappointed. I was certainly not with Tandoor Oven. The chicken tikka is fresh and succulent, not rubbery, and feels like good quality meat and ingredients. It’s spiced to perfection, I don’t like when it’s too creamy, but the ratio of cream to curry is on point and the flavor is just perfect. It’s exactly what you’re looking for when you’re craving chicken tikka masala. I’ve been eating Indian food all my life and I have to say this place is top 5 for me at least. I’m so impressed and can’t wait to try more of their food! If you’re contemplating where to order on the upper east side, look no further.",

Lunch service seemed to be staffed well, plenty of people circulating and the seating  was instant. Our food was prompt to arrive at the table, hot and ready to eat. Overall service was good. We sat down to a gorgeous outdoor October lunch.\n\nWings were a great appetizer, crispy and sizeable but the BBQ sauce seemed to be the entire flavor profile and the chicken offered nothing of its own; not a deal breaker. Budget pretzel bites with your standard grocery store brown mustard are genuinely overpriced for what they are; lesson learned if there is a future visit. Sadly, the pulled pork sandwich my wife ordered disappointed us the most. The pork was hardly pulled, more of a chunked consistency which gave careless vibes from the kitchen staff and the pork offered nothing without the (same) BBQ sauce to save the day.  The fries that came with both dishes seemed to be from 3 separate time zones. Some were fresh, some were dry, others were stale.  I ordered the Fried Cod sandwich ( with fries ) which I can't say bad things about, but I wouldn't pay for it again.  We love to support our local businesses and eat out regularly in the river towns so I hope this was a fluke.",

The pizza looks like it could be good as does the chicken parm...  but I didn't order these.  I would order the Chicken Parm if I were to do it all over again.  Why didn't I this time?  Well, this dish is so much better with veal, I figured I would be disappointed and they don't offer it with veal.  Quite frankly one measure I use for a good Italian spot so fail number one.  Unfortunately if you didn't want pizza the menu was challenging -as in to find something interesting-  and the server staff not helpful at all.   I ended up getting the spaghetti with garlic and oil; and it was extremely disappointing.  I personally could have cooked the same dish a 100x better easily.  Basically tasted almost like plain noodles.  In other words you get very close just by boiling noodles in water.  At $21/22 dollars before tax it was just a ripoff.  Easily the worst Italian dish I've had in as long as I can remember...years and years.   Making it worse this place was cash only, just making the bad food inconvenient as well.   Nothing here to make me ever go back.  Given that other people have rated it higher, I guess I just ordered poorly....",

The dish with fresh mozzarella balls were so delicious! We didn't have a chance to indulge in desserts because my son was tired and cranky. But I'll be back for sure. I can't wait to return!",

The homemade pasta special of the day (ours was a tagliatelle Bolognese) was a standout—saucy, savory, and clearly made with care. Same goes for the pizza: thin, crisp crust with a char that tells you someone back there knows what they’re doing. This isn’t fine dining and it doesn’t pretend to be—thankfully. It’s cozy, loud, slightly chaotic, and full of charm. The chicken Parm is textbook in the best way: crispy breading, gooey cheese, rich sauce. Service was fast and unfussy. It’s the kind of place that feels like it’s been holding it down for decades because it has. If you want polished and pretentious, go elsewhere. If you want legit red-sauce comfort and a room with character, Little Frankie’s delivers.",

I got a ham & cheese rice ball from their signature sides & a roast beef hero with mozzarella, onions & gravy which they’re know for. Which came to a little over $25. I then noticed a sign for desserts & I couldn’t pass trying a red velvet gelato truffle which ended up being a little less than $8 (I didn’t ask the price). The rice ball was  tasty & the roast beef was pretty good & very filling. Later in the day I had the gelato truffle which was ok. If you’re in the area & in want something simple for lunch you should give it a try.",

What I can say is that every time I ate from there I was not disappointed. Firstly their bread is top notch . The food is always hot . The food seems always fresh and even cooked with love. The delivery men are sweethearts .The wait on the order is short . The food comes at a timely fashion . I’m sure you can get something affordable that makes your full under ten dollars ; which is hard in nyc , with that being said if you around or driving in this area and want to eat something quick for yourself or family don’t forget this deli in which I got food here November 2024 to be exact getting a chicken sandwich that I still remember to this day that being the one with bbq and cheese and chicken but this one was just as flavorful and fulling .

You can request more but I didn't feel like I needed it. Good amount of beef and you can request as many caramelized onions as you want.

    "text": "Let’s start with the fact that I’m just a year removed from living in Paris and miss it deeper than he sea covers the ocean above.  There are special few places for me that transcend local, this is one of those restaurants, I feel like I’m back home in Paris, for even a brief moment.  I recommend the escargot for an appetiser and I would like to have tried the fried squid but I picked the fois gras while excellent the matching apple sauce purée was more miss than hit.  I have had the steak,duck, and lamb.  I recommend them in that order personally, with the steak barely passing the canard.  The service is simply devastatingly good and the people as kind as can possibly be.  There’s no negatives I have and if you read my other review’s you know that’s rare.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOliver’s: Once a Favorite, Now a Maybe\n\nI’ve been a longtime fan of Oliver’s — the ambiance, the French bistro aesthetic, the sense that you’ve stumbled into a little corner of Paris tucked into Brooklyn. But my most recent visit made me question if the magic is fading.\n\n👎 Service: Cold and Defensive\n\nOur waitress was… difficult. Dismissive, oddly defensive, and unwilling to take accountability. At one point, she claimed I didn’t get the dessert menu because I had stepped outside to smoke — which I hadn’t. Instead of simply placing the menu on the table like any competent server would, she made it my fault. That kind of interaction just kills the mood.\n\n🫤 Food: Technically Fine, Totally Forgettable\n\nEverything was cooked well, sure. But nothing tasted like anything special. Sauces were bland. Seasoning was minimal. No dish stood out. It all felt uninspired, like the chef was following a script but forgot the soul.\n\n💸 Price: $127 — For What?\n\nWith service that felt icy and food that didn’t deliver, $127 for one person felt absurd. I’ve had better meals at half the price where I was treated like a human being, not an inconvenience.\n\n⸻\n\nI’m hoping this was just an off night. Oliver’s has been great in the past. But the vibe, the food, and the service all missed the mark — and for now, I can’t recommend it the way I used to.",

I ordered the chicken and  broccoli Alfredo. My friend had the lasagna. Overall I liked the dish. Lots of broccoli which I liked. It was cooked to perfection. The sliced grilled chicken was delicious. The sauce however was lacking. Very bland, I didn't taste any parmesan. The sauce tasted more like just a heavy cream. I could clearly see grated Parmesan on top.  However it seemed to be lacking in the sauce. The lasagna was good. For the prices. It would be nice to have a small house salad included.",

AGAIN!\n\nThe term 'izakaya' is a fusion of 'i' (to stay) and 'sakaya' (sake shop) so we did just that- small plates tapa style and ideal to bring a partner in crime to try more- and otherwise \"izayaka\" typically described as a local food tavern / pub- but hands down appeasing our hungry palettes and and certainly plan to go back! Taste and enjoy... slowly! We got super lucky that on a Saturday night after 7 there was a table for 2 as walk-ins!\n\nAdmitting I've tried making Takoyaki at home (still work in progress), but soooo tasty here (main pic) as was the grilled hamachi collar ( yellowtail collar aka \"fish cheeks\"- portion behind the gills that I don't see often & loved when I lived in LA near LIttle Tokyo- and could find more regularly), pork belly mazemen (comes on a bed of ramen), softshell crab roll, seaweed salad and - and well, I'm usually too excited partaking to take pics, but just sharing a few here for good measure. Staff was busy and for such a small crew working small plates- and doing so much- yet super nice and friendly!\n\nDefinitely hope to go back myself for the sashimi and rolls- and for dinner again with my honey to share and try the blue fin tuna rib, short rib, and Karaage (fried chicken)... and meanwhile simply confirming how much dinner last night hit the spot- SUCH a nice treat- and ready to return for round 2! 😍🙏🏽",

It’s nice to have some asian flavors in the neighborhood 😊\nAll the food tastes great. The pork belly mazemen was our favorite! The pork was really well seasoned and the poached egg and sauce that coats the noodles was so luxurious. The whole squid and the grilled vegetables were probably the weakest dishes. The squid was nicely cooked and the sauce was tasty, but it could have used some lemon. The sauce on the grilled vegetables was also really yummy but we felt the vegetables themselves could have been cooked a bit longer; they were on the harder side to bite into. Everything else tasted great! Next time we’ll make sure we order one serving of yuzu cheesecake per person, instead of sharing 😅\nThe servers were very sweet and attentive though the food took a while to come out. Probably just due to it being the first week of opening and assume they’re still smoothing out the logistics.\nIt was a little bit on the pricey side—we spent $100+ for two people with no drinks.\nOverall we’ll definitely be back and will bring our friends in the neighborhood too!",

    "text": "As someone visiting from out of town, I was happy to find a dim sum restaurant close to the airport. The restaurant features a welcoming atmosphere, but the service felt inconsistent. It took a while for anyone to greet me, as the host station was unattended when I arrived. While my male server with glasses and the first host (tall lady) I interacted with were courteous, the short lady who handed me my check was noticeably unfriendly. I also observed her checking on other non-Asian tables with much more warmth, which was disappointing. She simply dropped the check on my table without a word or even a simple thank you.\n\nFortunately, the male server was kind and offered a pleasant farewell when I left, which helped end the visit on a better note. The food itself was mediocre - I had the shrimp cheung fun (with tiny shrimp) and siu mai, and ordered the Peking duck bun to go.\n\nOverall, a mixed experience that leaves room for improvement, especially in consistency of service.",

    "text": "An Absolute Must-Try: The Crispy Szechuan Lobster at Red Chilli, Syracuse!\n\nIf there’s one dish that defines indulgence with flair, it’s the Crispy Szechuan-Style Lobster at Red Chilli. The moment it arrives, you’re greeted by the intoxicating aroma of toasted chilies, garlic, and peppercorns that promise both fire and finesse. The lobster itself is perfectly cooked—tender and juicy inside, encased in a thin, golden-crisp shell that crackles at first bite.\n\nWhat makes this dish unforgettable is the balance: the numbing warmth of authentic Szechuan peppercorns dancing with the sweetness of fresh lobster meat, all glazed in a glossy, slightly smoky sauce that clings lovingly to every piece. Each mouthful is a symphony of crunch, spice, and ocean-fresh flavor.\nPair it with steamed rice or simply savor it on its own—it’s the kind of plate that makes you slow down, close your eyes, and appreciate how perfect seafood can be when prepared with mastery.\n\nRed Chilli’s presentation is stunning, too—the deep crimson chilies scattered like jewels, the lobster gleaming beneath a light dusting of scallions and sesame. It’s a show-stopping dish that feels festive yet refined.\n\nWhether you’re a spice lover or just someone who appreciates fine seafood, this Crispy Szechuan Lobster is reason enough to visit Red Chilli. Once you try it, you’ll find yourself planning your next trip back before you’ve even finished the plate.",

    "text": "Personal Opinion Summary:\n\nFood Quality: is good!! should go and try\nService: There IS a way to pay with CARD!! Even though they say Cash only.\n\nHere is the story:\n\nI recently visited this restaurant with my partner. While the food was genuinely enjoyable and the atmosphere was pleasant, I feel it’s important to share an issue we experienced so future customers are aware.\n\nWhen we were seated, the server told us that the restaurant accepted cash only and pointed us to an ATM outside. Because of that, one of us naturally went to withdraw cash. However, as we were using the ATM, the same server approached us again and suddenly mentioned that they could actually accept card payments through a QR code if the ATM doesn't work. Which it worked totally fine.\n\nThis wasn’t just a minor inconvenience, it felt intentionally misleading. We weren’t upset about the ATM fee; what bothered us was the way the information was delivered. Instead of being transparent from the start, we were pushed toward withdrawing cash first and only later told that card payment was an option. That kind of behavior felt disrespectful and unnecessarily deceptive.\n\nWhat made it more concerning was that we watched several other customers go through the exact same confusion. Despite the restaurant listing debit cards as an accepted payment method on Google Maps, the server repeatedly told people that only cash was allowed. The inconsistency and the way it was communicated were genuinely disappointing.\n\nThat being said, I want to be fair: the food was quite good, and under normal circumstances, I would return. But the way the payment situation was handled left such a negative impression that I’m hesitant to come back despite the quality of the meal.\n\nI hope the restaurant can address this issue and provide clear, honest payment information moving forward. Better communication from staff would greatly improve the overall dining experience.",

This pho should be straight banging but despite all that it does not live up to the billing. The pho chicken was rubbery. The bag of add ins was sparse. The broth was firmly classifiable as nothing special and where there should be an herbal almost medicinal quality to good pho broth it was just kinda sweet. Good pho should have the same restorative, ease creating, heart opening quality that every other cultures oldest soups share. Matzo ball. Korean chigae, pozole. The woman next to me at the counter said she had been going for 10 years and that they had indeed lost their touch. She said try China town. The bahn mi was alright but similarly nothing special.",

Their desserts and cocktails are a highlight.\n\nService & Management: 0/5\nSadly, the management ruined what could have been a perfect evening. My sister and I visited on a freezing winter night in NYC (December 2024) with a small, securely wrapped bag of lemons in our tote. Despite our confirmed reservation, the receptionist rudely assumed we intended to eat outside food and made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome from the start.\n\nThe tasting menu we ordered was incredible, but we were hurried to place our order and finish quickly because the kitchen was “closing soon.” If the restaurant plans to close, why accept reservations for that time? The entire dinner felt rushed.\n\nAfter paying, we waited inside for our cab, only to be asked to step out into sub-zero temperatures so they could lock up. It was one of the coldest nights of the season.\n\nI genuinely feel bad for the chef—their exceptional culinary talent deserves management that respects guests and complements the food.

The server was exceptional at explaining the menu options and he was very attentive. The service overall exceedingly made our first time there one to remember. The food was beyond anything we've both experienced and definitely savored every moment of our meal. The dessert was outstandingly perfection. We did add on an additional dessert \"The Egg\" and we're glad we did. Service from beginning to end was stellar. We tried non-alcoholic beverages Lychee Nectar and Raspberry Nectar both were very refreshing and perfectly sweet. We enjoyed our first experience at Le Bernardin. Will definitely revisit in the near future.",

    "text": "Le Bernardin continues to justify its legendary status as one of New York City’s finest dining establishments. Our recent prix fixe lunch experience reaffirmed why this restaurant has maintained its position at the pinnacle of seafood cuisine for decades.\n\nFrom the moment we were seated the service struck the perfect balance between attentive and unobtrusive. Every member of the staff demonstrated genuine warmth and deep knowledge of the menu. Our sommelier deserves special recognition and his wine recommendations were impeccably matched to our dish selections, elevating each course and creating harmonious pairings throughout the meal.\n\nThe culinary journey itself was extraordinary. The opening amuse-bouches set an elegant tone with refined, delicate flavors that showcased the kitchen’s precision. The caviar service was presented with theatrical flair, accompanied by perfectly executed blinis and traditional accompaniments. The raw fish course demonstrated the restaurant’s mastery of preservation techniques—silky, perfectly seasoned, and visually stunning.\n\nThe main course was a masterclass in technique: impeccably cooked fish adorned with toasted almonds, vibrant vegetables, and a sauce that brought everything together without overwhelming the star ingredient. Each element on the plate had purpose and demonstrated the kitchen’s respect for premium ingredients.\n\nLe Bernardin’s continued excellence isn’t just about maintaining standards — it’s about evolution while honoring tradition. Chef Eric Ripert’s vision remains as relevant and inspiring today as ever. This is destination dining at its finest, and our lunch was worth every moment. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a world-class seafood experience in New York City.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The food at the lounge was still outstanding — the skate dish in particular was absolutely perfect, delicate and full of flavor, showcasing the precision and finesse the restaurant is known for.\n\nWhat truly stood out, though, was the kindness of the team. Even though our son’s birthday is still a month away, they went out of their way to celebrate him and make him feel special. That thoughtful gesture meant the world to us and turned a wonderful meal into a beautiful family memory.\n\nThank you to everyone at Le Bernardin for such a warm and memorable experience — we’ll treasure it and can’t wait to return!

We celebrated our engagement here and it was truly an unforgettable all around evening.\n\nPer Se has been a bucket list item for me for over a decade. The experience did not disappoint - the food, I will say, not every dish was amazing. It is my first 3 star experience so I don’t have a good comparison, but at the price point I expect EVERY dish to blow me away.\n\nThey also had the largest wine list I have ever seen, they give you a whole iPad to look through!\n\nThe meal started off so strong with the classic oysters and pearls dish. Seriously this set the bar so high and left me feeling like I will never be the same after this meal lol. It’s been several months since we dined here and looking through my photos, the rest was fairly forgettable. I will note that every dish is truly a work of art, and some were prepped in a way that you couldn’t even imagine food being prepped that way. But again, nothing blew us away in terms of taste. The main meat dishes were nothing special.\n\nThe dessert was plentiful and very “classic”. Nothing out of the box or super imaginative.  We were actually so full by dessert we had a few of them boxed for us to take home.\n\nThe service is top tier. The staff really made us feel special and everyone was congratulating us on our engagement and it felt truly genuine.\n\nThe interior and overall vibe feel classic. I read a review it feels dated but it feels so classic NY to me.\n\nOverall, it was a special night and a bucket list item crossed off the list. Unforgettable experience for sure but our expectations were set so high that not every dish hit the mark. Thank you to the team at Per Se for a memorable evening!",

My wife and I went for dinner and enjoyed two incredible bottles of wine, a Barolo and a St. Georges Nuits, both perfectly paired with the flow of the tasting menu.\n\nWhat really sets Per Se apart is how every single element on the plate has its own voice. Each bite delivers a completely unique taste identity—nothing blends into the background, nothing feels repeated. It’s precision, creativity, and balance at the highest level.\n\nYes, it’s a splurge, but this was time and money exceptionally well spent.

The dough didn’t feel fully cooked. We should have returned it as we didn’t finish it/enjoy it.\n\nWe would have preferred if instead of a ricotta, there would have been a pizza with a blue cheese like Gorgonzola for example.\n\nThe staff was super kind and the atmosphere inside/outside is very friendly.\n\nPrices aren’t too expensive and there’s the option of buying slices, which we loved.\n\nBest part? How thin and crunchy the dough was.",

    "text": "In my Summer 2025 Pizza Top 5 list, Bleecker Street Pizza comes in third place.\n\nBleecker St. Pizza is hyped by several NYC bloggers. I can understand the hype. The slices are very tasty. I had a Margerita (Cheese) a Peperoni with Jelapenos. The crust is a bit too crispy for me and the Mozzarella dominates the slices. The tomato sauce is great. OMG, the jelapenos blew me away - I thought I was used to hot food. I looove the level of spiciness! The ice-cold Coke saved me. The bit too much fat on the pizza can easily be wiped off with napkins. Overall it is a typical NYC pizza with pretty good quality and definitely worth trying.\n\nThe shop has two seating areas inside and one outside on the busy 7th Avenue. It's not exactly charming; there are TV screens everywhere and the rooms are very spartanly furnished. Overall, the shop fits in very well with the neighborhood, on the border of East and West Village, where five of New York's top pizzerias are located.\n\nI guess I was very lucky because on my visit there was no waiting line at all!\n\nI recommend Bleecker St. Pizza.",

It’s shaped like kibbeh rather than the traditional round shape, they start frying them as soon as you walk in and offer you a piece as you wait in line to place your order and it’s the best starter before your meal. That is if you can fight the urge to get more and order something else instead which I personally failed at and proudly had one too many pieces that day, no regrets.

The place is nice and humble, and the owner or manager was extremely kind and attentive. All three of us got the lobster risotto. The lobster risotto was this nice risotto where the lobster was incorporated into every bite, along with other components-they all made sense in the dish. The grana padano was an incredibly tasty cheese that I put on my spinach. We also got a few appetizers like the calamari and the prosciutto and they were refreshing. It is not recommended to put cheese on seafood, as the cheese overpowers the seafood. This is my second time going to this place, and yet again, I wasn’t disappointed.",

We had the Fritto misto (calamari) appetizer and the Caesar salad to start - the salad was amazing quite honestly! The gluten free croutons were the best (I usually am never able to get croutons with salad!). For the main meal we had the pollo bacon risotto and the spinaci asiago pasta. The risotto - fantastic! The pasta was good but please allow the server to add cheese to it! I asked them to skimp on the cheese and I needed to add salt to it which was my mistake. When the server came back I asked them to put the normal amount of cheese on it and that fixed it. For dessert we had the special which was the raspberry chocolate tart.... OMG.... Phenomenal!!!

Dessert was great too.\n\nWhat made the experience subpar was the service. We sat outside and ordered a bottle of wine, but bugs started to fall into our wine glasses that we barely drank so we let our server know. She was kind about it and even offered to seat us inside without us asking, which we were surprised about and took her upon her offer. However, once we were seated inside, the entire experience went downhill. We hadn't finished all of our food from outside, and they said they would take care of moving everything inside but they only brought in our appetizers and tossed our half eaten bread which we were hoping to finish. Our new wine glasses were filled with the remainder of the bottle of wine we ordered and we had to ask about the two glasses of wine that were taken from us due to bugs being in them (eventually someone came and refilled our glasses but I wish we didn't need to ask). We also waited 30-45 minutes before dessert was served and it only came because we had to ask for it.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the restaurant for food but wouldn't recommend it for the service. Given its price point and reputation, my friends and I were all very disappointed and it definitely put a damper on our night and celebration. We appreciated the staff trying to improve our experience initially but we would've much rather stayed outside had we known this was the experience we were going to receive.",

The whole Fern Botanica team is supremely talented, wonderfully kind, and ridiculously fun, and our florals were straight out of a dream. We would have Pinterest-ed our own wedding photos, which seems like the goal to achieve!! Julia entertained our odd requests & knew what we wanted, even when we didn’t. Our chuppah was breathtaking, and the bud vases across the tables were the subject of many guests’ glowing compliments! Our friends even commented on the gorgeous color of the candlesticks. Truly, the Fern team pulled together the most beautiful design and exceeded all of our expectations. We couldn’t recommend them more. Thank you, Fernies!",

Julia came to see me in my apartment the morning of to tell me about my flowers. I was so thrilled and happy to finally meet her!!

The views are spectacular.\n\nFood was amazing, they even gave us several amuse bouche in between waiting for our main dishes on the chefs tasting menu. The BBQ portion was cooked in front of us so we didn’t need to cook or cut the meats ourselves. We had the regular prime rib menu and it was fantastic. The galbi was marinated for 24 hours and you could tell the marinade penetrated deep into the core of the meat. Every morsel was savoured. The basque cheesecake was the cherry on top to end the meal. Loved the overall presentation and the flow of the meal. Will come again next time.",

Unfortunately, this time the experience was a bit disappointing.\n\nWe were seated but waited around five minutes without menus or attention. After calling someone over, we ordered water, but it never arrived before the waiter came to take our food order. My friend’s salad came out first, mine didn’t, and the wine we ordered never showed up. At one point, I was even served a dish I hadn’t ordered.\n\nEventually, one of the managers noticed and took care of us — from that moment everything was great, and the wagyu was absolutely delicious. Still, all those small service issues added up and made the evening less enjoyable, especially since I’d been so excited to return.",

I've just recently tried both their beef and roasted pork soups with rice noodles and they were so delicious and comforting! They also do their Thai iced tea just right and have good vegetable spring rolls! Service is warm and friendly even if they get so packed and busy.

The cocktails were outstanding, with playful names inspired by music icons—one after my favorite Beyoncé track, Alien Superstar, and another, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, honoring the infectious Selena hit. Each drink was superb, with a subtly botanical character that felt especially fitting given the restaurant’s proximity to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\n\nFor brunch, I enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros and the French toast. The Huevos Rancheros featured perfectly cooked short rib, which proved to be the highlight of the dish. The French toast struck a harmonious balance between sweet and savory; fresh blueberries and raspberries, paired with a delicate caramel drizzle, eliminated any need for syrup.\n\nI also sampled the shrimp and grits, which were equally impressive. Even before tasting the shrimp itself, the rich flavor of the seafood infused the grits beautifully. The shrimp were plump, generously portioned, and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe staff were exceptionally kind, attentive, and worked seamlessly as a team. I was fortunate to meet one of the owners, whose humility and graciousness left a lasting impression. I look forward to returning to explore the upcoming seasonal menu",

The portions were pretty large, and while I initially had hopes of bringing half my chicken entree home, I ate all of it. The side of corn cooked with miso was fantastic too",

The pork was excellent, tender and flavorful with no overly porky tasty. The seafood pancake had a great texture and had plenty of seafood. The soup also had plenty of seafood and was tasty.\n\nWe spent around $40/pp after tax and tip for two people’s lunch.

The meaty taste is spectacular and pairs really well with the kimchi and jalapeños. The bugolgi had a wonderful flavor that’s a bit on the sweet side. Really goes well either way the rice. The seafood tofu stew was also great but would appreciate it if the mussel’s shell didn’t break into the soup.",

You can tell they are really proud of their daily homemade tofu.\n\nThe first one was cooked 3 layers pork with sides of kimchi, jalapeno, garlic, and soybean paste sauce. It was so delicious. The pork was cooked perfectly. It was soft with nice bouncy texture. It pairs very well with the soybean paste sauce. I basically licked the saucer clean.\n\nThe tofu stew was also very nice. The broth was umami and spicy. The tofu was superb. Rich and elegant of natural soybean flavors. The server informed me that the broth was seafood based. The white noodles were a plus to the dish.\n\nAll the side dishes were so delicious. I think I asked refills for 3 times. Today I got stew potatoes and radishes, cold string beans with garlic, eggplant with mushrooms, pickled radishes, and a cold seaweed dish. My favorites were the eggplant and the string beans. The potatoes had nice flavor, too. I believe I tasted something like miso.\n\nThe servers were attentive and friendly. Even though they were all so busy, they still take time to make sure my needs were met. Overall, I had a great time dining here. I’ll definitely come back with more people. The portions of the foods were great. PLEASE SHARE THE TOFU STEW. I was almost too full to walk after I finished all my foods.",

I ordered the spicy kimchi tofu stew and was very satisfied. The stew had a nice variety of seafood that complemented the spice of the broth perfectly, and the tofu was a real standout that brought the whole dish together. After we finished our meals, our waiter poured some tea into our rice bowls and served it to us, explaining that it helps with digestion. The tea was unsweetened, and the combination with the rice wasn’t my favorite, but the gesture was thoughtful. Our waiter was also very funny and extremely helpful in guiding us through the menu!",

The collard greens had that comforting, slow-cooked depth of flavor, and the mashed potatoes were creamy and well seasoned. And of course, the cornbread was a highlight — warm, fluffy, and perfect with a little butter.\n\nThe portions are generous, the presentation is inviting, and you can tell everything is made with care.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, with a classic Harlem charm. We sat in the covered outdoor section, which was comfortable and had a nice view of the neighborhood.

We got seated at 5:10pm. One person received their food around 6pm (she ate by herself). The 4 of us got our food at 6:36pm. OVER AN HOUR LATER. We were told that the one person at our table got their food first because they thought it was a single order.  The waitress apologized but did not ask if we wanted to talk to the manager.  So one of our guest asked the waitress if we can get a 10% discount due to the long wait. That’s when the waitress said we need to talk to the manager.  The manager came and gave us 10% off.  Also, the waitress never brought out the dessert until we asked for it (comes with the meal.)  the sweet potato pie came out cold. HOWEVER, the food was really, really good. The greens were delicious, cornbread delicious. the cornbread stuffing was delicious. Yams, mac and cheese, Turkey… delicious. Our desserts—  came at the end and we took it to go.  We also saw another waitress with a visible irritated face. But we take it as she didn't want to work on Thanksgiving. Next time— she should take the day off.\n\nBut Would I go back. Absolutely!

The pancakes tasted as if they were overcooked in oil and the French toast was soggy as left in the egg batter far too long and the eggs my other family member got were dry and disgusting. I am very upset not just with the food but also not once was it stated there would be a forced group charge of 20% ontop of being served this horrible food then to add complete insult to injury they charged me an additional 10 dollar tip when I clearly wrote 0 for additional tip. I cannot believe they are still in business like this. I have never in my 40 years of existence have I ever had experienced such a horrible breakfast from anywhere!!!!!

HUGE basil lemonade. Fab Arnold Palmer. Great.\n\nTacos were whatever ngl. Get the pizza!!\n\nThis restaurant is part of bar verde, the Mexican vegan restaurant, too.

They moved (on the same block I think?) into a place that looks a little tighter inside but had an outdoor seating.\n\nCame with a party of 3 and sat inside for a quiet Saturday night dinner—interior seating was maybe half full and exterior seating was packed.\n\nWarning interior didn’t have AC running.\n\nGot two pizzas and jackfruit tacos\n\nJackfruit tacos: Good but lacked a sauce or spice that left it getting drowned out by the much more flavorful pizzas\n\nTruffle cashew cream pizza: Excellent. Third time getting it and every time it’s been a hit. Flavorful spread of mushrooms on cashew cheese\n\nSpicy Pepperoni Pizza: Pepperonis themselves quite good on a tomato, basil, cheese base. Note the pepperonis have coconut in them in case you’re allergic.\n\nAlso got two cocktails and a mocktail, but nothing to report there. My Moscow mule was largely ice.\n\nUnfortunately, the owner is apparently a terrible person according to the April 22, 2024 NYTimes article, but the food is good especially for vegans.",

    "text": "Had always wanted to go to the Double Zero in Venice, CA, so I was excited to finally try the location in NYC!\n\nFirst off, I found the location to be a bit confusing. There’s two restaurants operating in the same space, so I nearly walked out thinking I was in the wrong place.\n\nNow onto the food and experience! I tried the mushroom pizza and cacio e pepe (see pic of pasta in my review). The pasta was really good. Creamy, lots of flavor, and great texture. It’s not the same as cacio e pepe in Rome, but nonetheless enjoyable.\n\nThe pizza tasted good but violated the #1 holy rule of pizza making: limp crust. I couldn’t pick up the slice without it sagging. Whomp, whomp. You also have to be a big fan of truffle oil, it’s used pretty liberally on this dish.\n\nThe service was great, though. Nice servers, very eager to refill a glass or clear the table, and the food came out fairly quick. Done and dusted. Love it.\n\nNote to kitchen: try to add some umami or fermented notes in the cacio e pepe to mimic cheese. A lot of places have a killer vegan cream sauce, but none have captured the special-ness (yes, I know that’s not a real word!) of cacio e pepe. There’s a lot of decent vegan cheeses out…it may yield a better result! If you crack the code I’ll gladly come back to try it!! 😊",

    "text": "From the lay-out of its website to the layout of its Lexington Ave. restaurant interior, Le Botaniste creates warm and inviting digital and real-life environments that reflect its emphasis on interconnected sustainability. On the website the company is open and transparent, from the philosophic values of its founders to the caloric count of its dishes. And when you walk into the restaurant, the space invites you in down a wide set of rounded stairs onto a black & white patterned floor with warm wooden cabinets and panels rising from it and boasting detailed carvings and scrollwork. Large, colorful pots sit on warmers next to tins of fresh fixings for grain bowls and salads, and the serving staff is extremely friendly and enthusiastic. My wife and I appreciated that we didn’t need to ask what was strictly plant based and what was gluten-free, since everything is! It was easy to place our order and the food was served quickly. The dining area is relaxing and inviting; my wife and I sat in the back section bound by white, brick walls and potted plants, and lit by a ceiling of skylights. Given all the positives mentioned above, I thought the food could have been better. The squash soup and the tomato sauce in the Spicy Chili Sin Carne each tasted like it came from a jar and, although it can be subjective, I felt the chili wasn’t at all spicy. The ingredients were fresh, but they just didn’t come together in a cohesive, flavorful way. I thought the same of the veggie balls, which lacked a definitive flavor. The chocolate pecan cookie was a little too sweet for me, and the omega 3 brownie a little too dry, although I did like the taste. Once Le Botaniste dials in its dish recipes, it will be firing on all cylinders!",

The food here is exceptional — creative, flavorful, and executed with real precision. Every dish feels unique, thoughtful, and beautifully balanced. The atmosphere is relaxed but polished, making it an easy place to enjoy a long, satisfying meal without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.\n\nOne thing I strongly recommend is choosing the wine pairing. Each course comes with a different wine selected specifically to match the flavors of the dish, and they absolutely nail it. The pairings elevate the food instead of overpowering it. You can tell the team put real effort into curating drinks that enhance the entire dining experience. If you’re coming here, don’t skip that option — it’s worth it.\n\nThe service was outstanding. The staff were attentive, warm, and genuinely enthusiastic about what they were serving. Dirt Candy is a no-tip restaurant, which I respect, but my server took such good care of me that I felt compelled to insist on giving her something extra. It took a bit of convincing, but she eventually accepted it with a big smile, and I could tell it truly made her day.

Definitely opt in for their wine pairing option, you won’t regret it. They not only handpick their wines but also pair those superbly with their food. My favorites dishes were hands down their dessert - which was an avocado dallop of ice cream with an egg cream and tortilla chips followed by their thai lasagna and then their onion tart, in that order. I’m so glad I chose this place for my first Michelin Star restaurant experience!",

The fully vegetarian tasting menu is incredibly creative, beautifully presented, and always packed with flavor. It’s a place where both vegetarians and meat eaters can enjoy an inventive, satisfying meal.\n\nThe pacing of the courses is perfect, with each dish building on the last without ever feeling rushed. The staff is warm, attentive, and knowledgeable, which makes the whole experience fun and memorable. Dirt Candy continues to surprise us with thoughtful dishes and unexpected flavor combinations, and it remains one of the best dining experiences in New York.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable night out.",

I wish I discovered this gem of a restaurant sooner. The vibe is of a comfy cozy neighborhood restaurant. We enjoyed the French onion soup, meatball sliders and the Bibb and Beets salad. The salad was absolutely delicious and worth coming back for that dish alone. I enjoyed my non-alcoholic drink but found the desserts a tad too sweet for my taste. The service was excellent. Jorge was especially hospitable and made us feel welcomed. I will be back soon.",

A very unique yet simple way of cooking the fish. The story goes that it used to be grilled until the grill went out in the first week and they’ve decided to broil ever since. They really go over and above to make sure you’re comfortable as well. It was very nice to feel well taken care of.",

She was friendly, knowledgeable and very flexible. We came about 15 mins before happy hour. We got our first round and tried to squeeze in a second round she told us not to rush and she’d hold the happy hour prices for us. She brought the drinks out for happy hour price about 15 minutes after happy hour ended. As working in a restaurant before I can understand if you’re the only person it can be a daunting task, but our server held her composure and smiled and kept up great service to every table. She definitely deserves a generous tip we left her and hopefully everyone has been tipping her the same as we did. I split a cheese pizza with my girlfriend and cousin. This pizza was hot, crispy, and tasteful. Man. Perfect amount of cheese and perfectly cooked. A lot of variety on the menu but we didn’t want to eat too much and settled with the pizza. Didn’t get much, so I can’t cover much in this review but the happy hour drinks, pizza and service were all worthy of 5 stars!",

    "text": "I booked a table at the Serendipity 3 Upper East Side restaurant for dinner on my wife's actual 60th birthday this evening as we really enjoyed our last visit there 10 years ago for her 50th birthday.\nAlthough we arrived 20 minutes earlier than our 5:15pm slot that I'd booked online, we were shown to a table within a few minutes. There's very little space between tables in the very small & cramped restaurant, so don't expect any privacy as we could clearly hear and follow the conversations of the diners on both the tables either side of us.\nOur super friendly server Randy asked if we were at the restaurant for any special occasion and my wife told him it was her 60th birthday without realising I'd already put all this in the 'what's the occassion?' section of their online booking form. He also asked if we had any allergies, which again I had already said we had none in the 'Any allergies or restrictions?' section of their online booking form. So clearly the servers don't see or don't bother to read the information provided online by their customers, rendering it a complete waste of our time!!!\nThe birthday girl had the American cheeseburger with fries, which was OK. I had the Grandma Holt's fried chicken sandwich with a pot of tea. The fried chicken was a bit dry, the bun was a bit stale and I found the fries to be a bit too salty. My wife was really looking forward to the superb peanut butter cheesecake dessert we enjoyed sooo much on our last visit. However, it was no longer on the menu so she had to settle for the Ultimate Creme Cheesecake, which came with side servings of hot fudge & strawberry sauce.\nOur fabulous server Randy put a candle on the top of my wife's cheesecake, lit it and encouraged everyone in the restaurant to sing happy birthday, which made her feel special. Whilst we were dining in the restaurant there were 4 other people celebrating their birthdays as well.\nThere's a photographer at the restaurant now, who went around every table taking photographs of customers and returning later trying to sell commemorative prints, which I found a bit tacky and touristy - not something I'd expect at a high end restaurant.\nThe decor in the restaurant looked very tired and we certainly didn't enjoy our meal there this time, compared to our exceptional experience 10 years ago. I feel sadly it's more of a tourist trap now, feeding off the embers of its former glory days, which have long gone. We didn't have any alcoholic drinks with our meal and I left feeling the $100 we spent there could have been better spent in one of the hundreds of exceptional restaurants in NYC for the special occasion of my wife's 60th birthday.",

My husband and I and our 2 girls (ages 6 & 9) loved all our food and desserts! My husband got a bacon cheese hot dog and I got the truffle burger. Both amazing. We all had more fries than we could eat. We also got the frozen hot chocolate to share, and each daughter got 1 scoop of ice cream with a topping, which was also more than they could eat. Despite it being packed and needing a reservation, our food came out super quickly. I was really impressed by that. And our waiter, Leo, was SO friendly, which made the overall vibe amazing. We hope to be back next time we visit the city!!",

Beetlejuice was incredible! All performers had charm, wit and were highly entertaining.\n\nThe service was great! We were greeted at the door and were asked to wait about 15 mins for a table (we didn’t get to reserve; and we went after 8pm). We were entertained by Beetlejuice outside and he gave us great laughs. We only waited about 5 mins til a table was free.\nOur drink of choice was the Big Fish bowl, delicious! We had the Mac n cheese and lalaurie fries which both delicious! We both got the Sweeney Todd filet mignon and it was great. For dessert we got the death by chocolate and Emily’s wedding cake. Portions are medium to small but filling.\n\nIt’s a bit pricey but gratuity is included and the performers put on a great show. They love taking pictures with you as well.\n\nWe had a blast!

It is a unique, fantastic, creative place and a tribute to New York and something that everyone should experience at least once. It is so hard to run a successful restaurant in New York City, especially through Covid, so it is speaks a lot as to what kind of place this is. If you were a beetle fan or even if you were not, this is a place you must visit in the village. The food is phenomenal, especially the steak and the drinks are even better. Small children would enjoy it if they’ve watched Beetlejuice and like the characters. So highly recommend. For NYC, the reasonable Price Fix menu is a treat.",

    "text": "This is such a hard review to leave because we are also restauranteurs.\n\nMy wife and I wanted some nice hearty salads for lunch so we looked up a few places. We ordered two salads (the mango salad and the arugula, mango, duck walnut, goat cheese salad—never had there been a more literal name for a salad which is fine—just hard to order on the phone).\n\nWe were told these two salads were going to be 35 minutes. Even during a busy rush (which would seem strange at 2:05), two salads shouldn’t take 35 minutes.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that the Arugala Duck Salad (for short) is described as tradition “New Orleans” style salad. We lived in New Orleans for 4 years and ate all over the city. It’s a culinary mecca. This is not close to anything traditional to New Orleans.\n\nThe salad was quite small for a $21 salad. Two salads totaled $56 which we don’t mind paying based on the food description. I’m in the food and beverage industry so I know the cost of goods. This was literally two handfuls of Arugal, some cubed mangos, a blob of coated goat cheese, and waaaay overcooked tiny slivers of duck breast. I understand the rising cost of business in this industry, but I could never to this to my patrons.\n\nThe duck was embarrassingly bad and the beef on my wife’s salad was so overcooked, it was almost inedible. The duck breast slivers were not only small and overcooked but rubbery. That’s strange because the fat wasn’t rendered properly so the skin was gelatinous and chewy so it being overcook was just a lack of care or  lack of training for the cook who cooked the duck breast. The packaging was so half hearted for $56 for two salads.\n\nThis was rough. I’d be willing to adjust my review with a response from the owners. But, as far as first impressions go, we won’t order again based off this experience.\n\nSo unfortunate in flavor and overpriced for the result.",

It was so kind! I have a difficult allergy and they were so respectful and accommodating. When the waiter changed and so something came which I couldn’t have they took it back, no questions asked.

Completely flat and tastes like it came out of a dirty gun.\n\nHOWEVER every time I come here I get the chicken platter, Mac and cheese, and a tuna melt. The chicken is succulent with a beautiful breading and is piping hot every time. It is served with a sweet honey butter that goes beautifully with the biscuits as well. The biscuits are good but not mind blowing, they are small and served 3 per order. The Mac and cheese can be dry depending on the batch but this most recent visit was perfectly creamy but still firm enough to slice. It is a baked style. The tuna melt is one of my favorites in the city. It has a massive amount of tuna inside but feels lighter than others I have had. It almost takes like the tuna is whipped. I can’t figure out what they do to the tuna but it’s great. The best part about this place is that the kitchen is open late. We actually came this time because the restaurant we were trying to go to had closed their kitchen early. It’s really great having this option in the area.",

A Rob recommendation is literal pixie dust.\n\nI entered 8 minutes before our scheduled time because my pops always told me \"if you're on time, you're late.\" I entered and saw a 6'2 burly figure with a worn in nike hat and legendary beard sipping on a Negroni, and realized Rob beat me here. Damn... Negroni on a Monday is so beast though.\n\nWe got a little booth in the corner, and I decided to hop on the Negroni train. I normally don't drink during the week, but sometimes the Negroni gods just force your hand. My nickname in college was actually \"Post Negrone.\"\n\nRob informed me that the hot chicken sandwich ($19) was the move, which checked out with my research from before dinner.\n\nI never really stop and smell the roses, as comfort is the enemy of progress, but sitting in this dimly lit dive bar sipping negronis with one of the best food creators on the internet, and someone I really look up to, forced me to have a moment of appreciation.\n\nBetween bites of one of the best crispy chicken sandwiches I have ever had in my life, we were talking about writing, editing, our favorite restaurants, youtube thumbnails, algorithms, favorite authors, upcoming shoot schedules, and lofty long term goals that really had me pinching myself. Like damn I'm really doing this, you know? I felt like I was living someone else's life, not mine. I didn't even really know this was possible.\n\nWe deleted these chicken sandwiches, chips and queso, and 2 rounds of negronis as the table next to us turned 2 different times. What a night, provided by an iconic ambiance, sensational chicken sandwiches, and my old friend, the negroni.\n\nIG @johnny.novo\nTiktok @jnov__\nSubstack @johnnynovo",

Debated for a bit and ultimately decided to stay because I’ll not be denied of my chicken sandwich lol.\n\nStarted off with the Orange Julio, as if it’s the grownup Orange Julius. Two sips in and immediate brain freeze. The vibe is a bit chaotic but the bartenders did a great job making sure everyone is well-hydrated with drinks. Shortly before 5pm, my bartender gave me the food menu as if she could read my mind.\n\nI got the mild breast sandwich and a small side of fries. The sandwich came out piping hot and prolly the juiciest chicken breast I’ve ever eaten. Could it be a wet brine process..? However, the chicken was a tad too salty for my taste. Still, I inhaled the sandwich. The fries were okay..? Nothing special but an adequate companion to my sandwich.\n\nAll in all, I was a very happy camper. I love the Commodore and I’ll be back for sure!",

Everything is electric blue and a little eclectic. The menu even has back lighting! Every menu needs this feature. The piano keys across the piano room was my favorite. Evidently, they also.habe live music on occasion. We only got drinks and apps and sat at the bar. We decided on Bang bang shrimp and Tempura Fried Cauliflower. Both were delicious... we had to get a second Cauliflower. The drinks were great and the bar tender took fabulous car of us. I will definitely be back for dinner.",

We've had 3 different servers and, for a newly opened restaurant in 2022 they were all attentive and knowledgeable... that is hard to come by for any restaurant new or old!\n\nI must say I am a fan of anything blue and there is plenty of blue lighting, accents and décor throughout but it is balanced by other textures and tones. There is a baby grand piano on the far end for the lounge/bar area. We haven't sat in the main dining room yet because the lounge is just too cool.\n\nWe've had the steak au poivre, stout braised pork chop and  prime rib entrees. For appetizers we have had the bao buns, smoked salmon that also comes with a tasty deviled egg. There is a bar/lounge menu and from that we've had the fried chicken, tuna tacos and pulled pork nachos. So, everything has been outstanding! The chef and his team are already in a grove.\n\nWhen we've gone it was on the weekend and the place was pretty much full but I don't think you'd have to wait long for a seat because they have a lot of options between the bar, lounge and dining room. From what I've experienced so far the future looks bright (and blue) for Storm King Lounge and Fare.",

The space is small, with only a few tables and mostly bar seating, creating an intimate, authentic atmosphere that’s perfect for a quick pre-show meal. We went around 5 p.m. before a Broadway performance, and by the time we left an hour later, a line was already forming out the door—a clear sign of its popularity. The ramen was fantastic, with rich, flavorful broth and perfectly cooked noodles that hit all the right notes of comfort and depth. A delicious, no-frills gem that’s well worth seeking out.",

It was cool seeing the solo chef prepare all the moving parts. Sadly, I did not feel like the seating was very comfortable, as the bottom part moved around on its own and there is no backing.\nService (5/5): Came in on a Friday afternoon and there was only 2 or 3 other solo patrons so I was attended to throughout my experience.\nToriburo Spicy (3/5): The noodles were a bit on the undercooked side so a little more chewy (which I like/prefer!) I like the homemade spicy paste that gave the dish another level of flavor! For the price point, I was definitely hoping that the pork charsiu piece would be a little more generous in portion size—however it’s really only 2 small slices. The flavor was there and a good blend of meat to fat ratio but just really to meager. The dish also does not come with any egg. I think I was hoping for a bit more flavor in the broth to wow me but it’s admittedly hard to compare paitan to tonkontsu.\nHappy Hour pricing Monday to Friday 12-6:30pm during the summer looks like $3-4 discounts off beers/sake!",

Every time I come here, I’m blown away by the quality of the food, the staff’s service, and the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant — it’s a solid 10000/10 every time.\n\nWith the chilly weather, I was craving DAESUN soju and seafood like in Busan, and this place turned out to be the perfect choice.\n\nWe had assorted Mak-hwe, mackerel, and scallop gimbap topped with uni and sweet shrimp. The rice is the most important part of Gimbap — and theirs is unbelievably good! The accompanying ssamjang and mayo sauces were just fantastic.\n\nAt one point, my friend accidentally dropped a spoon, and the staff immediately replaced it with a new one — even bringing over a Tide stain remover stick just in case it got on her clothes. Their attentiveness and kindness were truly impressive...🥹\nWe ended the meal with Dolsot Al-Bap and Hap-Cheon Pork Soup the perfect pairing with soju that just went down so smoothly.\n\nMy friends who were visiting said they were so touched by the taste and service that they almost cried.\n\nAriari is one of those rare spots in New York that never fails to make me happy. The food is amazing, complemented by the warm hospitality that’s rare to find in New York!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️\n\nWriting this review is making me crave it again — I think I’ll go back this week. Now that it’s getting cold, it’s the perfect time to visit Ariari. Highly, highly recommend!",

The flavors blended so well together and felt so complete, and the texture was right on point. I was especially impressed with the fried sea eels, a perfect combination of crunchy and soft, sweet and salty. I hadn't seen this dish anywhere else so credits to the restaurant's creativity.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive, friendly and thoughtful. I brought a box coming in and he helped me put it away before dining. After we were done, he brought the box out along with a big paper bag (containing my leftover pancake) so that I could put my box in and carry it more easily. The lady who brought our receipt was very friendly as well.\n\nOverall, incredible food and service! I'd love to come back and try other dishes on their diverse menu.",

He brought me a gin and soda. After I tasted it, I asked him what he put in the drink and he said gin and soda. I pointed out that’s not a Tom Collins, it’s a different drink, which I would have ordered had I wanted that. He said he’s not from the 1900s, and I passed him my drink and asked him not to make me another. At that point I didn’t want a drink from someone who’s such a jerk. Not that I felt welcome at that bar, but I’d never go back.",

Wrapped things up with a raspberry sorbet that was light, refreshing, and the perfect finish.\n\nService was chill, not too in-your-face, which I liked, though I had to wave for attention a couple times.

My uncertainty about what to have for lunch didn’t end with which restaurant to choose but also what to eat. I ended up ordering 3 starters. I went with the chili hoisin duck bao which was delicious. Their version of calamari, a chili squid which was interesting but I don’t think I’ll try again. And Tokyo fries which was also interesting but I don’t think I’ll be trying again. My sister’s birthday was on Monday so naturally on Tuesday I ran to Macys (Herald Square) to get her a little something & decided to try Wagamamma once again since I felt or was cold enough to have ramen. I sat at the bar this time & ordered the Korean fried chicken bao for my appetizer & the chicken gyoza ramen for my main. Oddly enough my main was served before my appetizer. The ramen was pretty good however I wasn’t a big fan of the Korean fried chicken. Since there was hardly any chicken involved. It’s a nice restaurant with polite staff however I don’t see myself going back anytime soon.",

The pad Thai was okay, but definitely not like the one you’d get in Thailand — milder and less bold in flavor. The duck ramen, on the other hand, was rich, a bit fatty in the best way, and absolutely satisfying.\n\nThe chicken salad was light and fresh, a good balance to the heartier dishes. Their famous bang bang cauliflower came with high expectations, but it was just okay — crispy but the sauce didn’t quite wow us.\n\nWe also had two bao buns: one vegetarian and one with chicken. Both were great — soft, fluffy buns with flavorful fillings. The chicken one especially stood out, with tender meat and a nice crunchy contrast.\n\nFresh-pressed juices were a highlight — especially the positive one, super refreshing and energizing. And the teas! One with lemongrass, the other with mint — both fragrant and calming.\n\nA nice spot for a casual meal with a twist, especially if you’re in the mood for variety and fresh drinks.",

Unfortunately, this visit was extremely disappointing, and I truly feel it was a WASTE of money.\n\nUpon entering, a female server guided me toward a bar seat. I politely asked if I could be seated by the window instead, as there were plenty of empty tables. She did not verbally respond and seemed quite dismissive.\n\nShortly after, a male server, who was kind and attentive, brought me a glass of tap water.\n\nHowever, the table was sticky and appeared dirty, which was concerning.\n\nRegarding the food — I wondered how they  are managing their ingredients and the recipe.\n\nPork Belly Bao ($11): The pork was extremely dry, and the toppings were poorly prepared.\n\nBeef Brisket Tantanmen Ramen ($23): The bamboo shoots and the kimchi tasted spoiled, with a sourness beyond the normal flavor. The beef brisket was very dry, and the broth and egg were cold. For a dish that is meant to be served hot, the cold egg was particularly unpleasant.\n\nI shared my feedback with the male server, who listened carefully and was understanding. I appreciated his attitude, which at least prevented the experience from being entirely ruined. Nevertheless, I spent $40 (including tip) for a deeply unsatisfying meal.",

And it was beautifully plated, the salmon was perfectly cooked tender and flaky, flavor on point, and just ask around perfection. I also ordered a pomegranate ginger ale and it was alright.

I want to make that really clear because if you like a thick cut fry that’s golden on the outside with a high “fuffly potato” ratio on the inside, you’ll enjoy it thoroughly because they’ve executed amazingly on that kind of fry. The problem in this case is me: I like a thin cut fry with more of the crunchy / crispy golden exterior and less of the interior of a fry. And they really are two different categories of fry. As far as execution on the former is concerned, it’s done well. I just don’t like that kind of fry. The black truffle mayo we got sounded great but fell very short of our expectations. Barely any truffle flavour and you have to buy truffle oil separately. The place does feel like a rendezvous for Diagon Alley’s shadiest wizards so that’s actually really cool especially because it feels like you’ve entered an olden times tavern restaurant in 18th century England. All in all if you like the thick cut fry scene they guys have executed beautifully, but if you’re like me I wouldn’t choose to come back here simply because of my preference for cut fries. I’m sure these guys would do an amazing job making those.",

    "text": "I have been running a traditional Belgian frituur “Oma’s Frit” for 15 years 🇧🇪. I walked in here out of pure curiosity, because Belgian fries are not just food — they’re a network of tradition and perfection, built over generations.\nThe secret to real Belgian fries lies in the quality and variety of the potatoes, the type of fat used, and precise control of temperature and frying time. Even how many potatoes are added to the fryer at once makes a difference: if you add too many, the temperature suddenly drops, which immediately affects the texture.\nA powerful fryer, the right fat, and especially the double-frying method with correct temperatures and timings are absolutely crucial.\nIn Belgium, potatoes are delivered fresh every day, and we mostly use Bintje potatoes because of their unique flavor and structure. Occasionally we switch to Agria, but nothing truly compares to good Bintjes.\nWith all that in mind, I was curious to give this place a try. I walked in… and honestly, I walked back out rather quickly. The bar for fries in Belgium is simply very high, and what I saw here didn’t reach that level.\n\nThis is not meant as negative criticism, just an honest observation: real fries… that’s something truly Belgian. 🇧🇪🍟",

    "text": "Our Love Story (and Margaritas) Start at Lupe’s.\nIt’s time to write a review for the most important restaurant in Soho NYC to me and my husband. Lupe’s isn’t just a place; it’s where our love grew, from dating to marriage. I’ll never forget how, when my husband was still my boyfriend, he’d always stop by before seeing me to grab a margarita. Three years later, it’s still his favorite bar,his ritual. After work, you’ll find him here, greeted by the kindest bartenders who treat him like family (and pour the most generous drinks). and of course the margaritas are the best in town!!! Period❤️❤️❤️\n\nThe corner spot, with its neon glow and lantern style lighting, feels like a secret hideaway romantic, cozy, and alive with energy. Summer nights on the patio under those red lights just so magic!\n\nWe’ve ordered takeout many times, but tonight we sat at my favorite corner table outside and had a proper feast: the vibrant shrimp salad, crispy fish tacos, tender beef tacos, and the most perfectly cooked fish plate. And the flan? Hands down the best, tortillas are so yummy 🤤 😋 and authentic, the taste just can bring you back to Mexico! Portions are generous, flavors are bright, and everything tastes impossibly fresh, no surprise, since the entire kitchen team is from Mexico.\n\nBut what makes Lupe’s special isn’t just the food or drinks，it’s the people. The staff radiates warmth, making every visit feel like coming home. You can always find the owner inside and make sure every dish and drink is perfect, so friendly to the customers. Lupe’s is the institution ❤️ Funny enough, if I ever can’t reach my husband? I know exactly where he’ll be: at Lupe’s, drink in hand, happy or (occasionally) mad at me. It’s his sanctuary.\n\nTo the team: Thank you for being part of our story. Here’s to many more years of tacos, margaritas, and memories. If you love Mexican food, Soho charm, or just feeling like family, Lupe’s is your spot. It’s not just a restaurant—it’s a piece of our hearts.",

Their pork chops over rice is done nicely, sits on top of rice covered by minced meat, side of half egg and sour vegetables. The price is great. My favorite thing here is to eat on the street. Sitting on the plastic stools, eating and watching people walk by. It's a cool vibe",

    "text": "As expected, the place was quite busy due to the hot weather. Watching a video of soba being made while waiting helped ease the boredom, and the food itself wasn’t bad. The tempura was crispy and tasty, but the dipping sauce for the soba was a bit too salty, and overall, the soba wasn’t particularly more flavorful compared to other soba places.\n\nConsidering how busy the restaurant was, the staff seemed understaffed. The team was moving around busily, but things didn’t seem well-organized, making their efforts appear somewhat inefficient. The host also came across as unfriendly. Rather than repeatedly telling every guest, “Can I put my name on the waitlist?” and “Just wait here,” it would probably be less frustrating for everyone—and easier for the staff—if they used a proper waitlist system like many other restaurants do. It felt like a missed opportunity to improve both customer experience and staff workflow. One staff member was clearing tables, wiping surfaces, handling new napkins, chopsticks, and cups, and then using the same hand to scoop ice from the ice bin and serve drinks—all without taking a single moment to sanitize or wash their hands. It definitely didn’t feel hygienic or sanitary. When I first received my food, something felt off. I noticed that the dishes were placed upside down on the tray, so I had to rearrange them myself. I understand they might have been busy, but it really showed how unprofessional the service was.",

I was recommended here by a family member and recently rediscovered it while doing some solo-exploring.\n\nI always grab their daily lunch combo as it gives you a bang for your buck. (If you’re a college student in the area, you’d be a fool not to give this place a chance.)\nBoth hot and cold soba options are solid (my brother prefers cold, I like hot) and we adore their dons.\n\nThere was one time I found something wrong with my order and they were so apologetic- immediately replacing my dish with a fresh one. I was happy to receive a fresh one (tempura deliciously hot out of the frier) and finished. That’s when they gave me a free green tea crème brûlée for my troubles. They didn’t have to do that, but they were so kind and profusely apologizing for the earlier blunder that I couldn’t help but tip well and applaud their service. My water was never empty!\n\nAll the food was delicious. Not too salty, not too sweet, but just right. Love Sobaya and will definitely keep coming back :)",

It was my mom’s birthday, and Matteo and Nick surprised us with a beautiful tiramisu topped with a candle and a bottle of champagne, completely on the house. That moment made the whole evening unforgettable.\n\nWe left with full hearts, full bellies, and big smiles. This is not just a restaurant—it’s a place where you’re treated like family.\n\nHuge thank you to the staff—you guys are amazing. 100% recommend Barbalu Bklyn to anyone who wants a truly delicious meal and an experience filled with warmth and joy.

I recently went there and was thoroughly impressed, especially by their take on comfort food classics.\n\nMy friends and I were craving something hearty, and we were not disappointed. We ordered a big chicken sandwich and a juicy burger to share, and both were outstanding. The chicken sandwich was a true showstopper—perfectly fried to a golden crisp while remaining incredibly moist and tender on the inside. It was a generous size and had a fantastic, flavorful crunch with every bite. The burger was equally impressive. It was cooked to a perfect medium, with a patty so juicy and rich that it practically melted in your mouth. The classic toppings and a toasted bun made for a flawless burger experience.\n\nWhat made the meal even better were the sides and drinks. The fries were a perfect companion, hot and crispy, and just the right amount of salt. And the cocktails were excellent. We each had a few different ones, and they were all expertly mixed and well-balanced—they weren't just an afterthought but a highlight of the meal. The entire place has a warm and inviting vibe, and the staff was friendly and attentive. For a spot that feels like a cozy neighborhood tavern but serves up incredible, elevated pub fare and great drinks, Dorlan's is a definite winner.",

It appeared they put our half-chewed sliders back into the oven or a plate to try to cook them, but they were still raw.\n\nWe had to tell the server that we did not want the raw ground beef patties.\n\nOur actual server was friendly and took the sliders off our bill.\n\nWe will be returning, but likely will not be trying the sliders again.",

It’s very distant, which is customary in most places outside of the states. They don’t coddle you, they just take your order and bring you food. Nothing wrong with that.

While the wait staff were polite and professional, she herself was an absolute nightmare to deal with.\nThe food was truly disappointing. The oil used tasted old and rancid — I immediately had to spit it out. My toddler was hungry, but there was no way I could feed him that food. We ordered a Shanghai-style dish that should have included shrimp and mushrooms, but instead it was made with cheap meat and vegetables. The cutbacks were obvious, and the scallion pancakes tasted frozen and flavorless.\nWhen we politely gave feedback about the quality of the dish, the owner became defensive and tried to bully us, insisting that nothing was wrong. She claimed they “only use new oil” because they have “so many customers,” yet the restaurant was completely empty on a Saturday night — we only ended up here because our favorite Shanghai spot nearby had a 40-minute wait.\nShe even demanded we pay for the dish despite our concerns. The experience was unpleasant from start to finish. I will never visit this place again, and it’s a shame to see such a poorly run restaurant misrepresenting the neighborhood’s dining scene.",

Everyone is so friendly and respectful. During Ramadan, they even asked if we were fasting and kindly brought us dates and water as a compliment — such a thoughtful gesture! When it was time to eat, they brought our food right away.\n\nWhat’s also great is the variety — it’s not only food from Muslim countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, but also Russian and Ukrainian dishes.

We’ve had Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, & Turkish food many times in the past but this is the first time we had Uzbek cuisine. There are some similarities or cross influences I assume, but the food was unique & delicious in its own rights.  We had lunch & loved the food (see pictures of what we had & descriptions) we ordered and would definitely come back for more!  The atmosphere & ambience was beautiful & clean.  The service was very good—the staff were polite & helpful.  No complaints overall.  Only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars were minor—our water glasses were not refilled & staff didn’t come by to check if anything was needed as hoped.  Something minor but could be improved to make an excellent overall experience.

It cost about $13 total with tax. They only have one standard size, no small or large options. Preparation was quick.\n\nThe lavash was soft at first, but in the parts where it was grilled, it had a better texture. The meat was somewhere in the middle – not bad, not great. I’ve already tried similar shawarma in another place run by a Georgian kitchen, and the sauce here had that same familiar taste. I couldn’t exactly identify the flavor – not sweet, not garlicky, not sour – but it reminded me of something I’ve had before in that regional style. Ingredient balance was good.\n\nThe portion looked like a standard medium shawarma. It was filling, but by the end it started to fall apart, which made it messy to eat. There’s seating available inside, and they offered a choice between spicy or not spicy. That was a nice touch.\n\nOverall, I’d rate it 3.5 out of 5. The place is decent, and the food is edible and filling. But if you’re looking for that crispy, bold Ukrainian-style shawarma – this is not the place. Don’t expect the same flavor you’re used to from back home.",

We were looking for a more intimate and casual setting rather than a more formal wedding in a reception hall and we fell in love with the food and the place going for dinner one night. Service was great on the night of and communication beforehand was top notch. Meryl was incredibly helpful with the logistics and provided not only reccomendations on vendors but also how to optimize the space (due to our large guest count). They were receptive to our thoughts and ideas of how we wanted the night to go and how it would fit with their space. They also lent us a projector to play a game and provided some of the decor (small candles, lanterns, and hanging linens). Overall they’re a well-oiled machine with the best food (3 course plated meal) — they’re a restaurant after all! 100% would reccomend duck confit. Our wedding coordinator said that we were given a very good price for the superb level and quality of service that was included. Overall, the staff are lovely and shows how passionate they are about making our big day wonderful -- would rate this a 100 out of 10 experience.\n\nRegardless if you’re looking to have your wedding here or not — 100% you should come here in a regular day have dinner here!!! My husband and I sometimes just drop by to eat (p.s. don’t think about it and just get the bread and butter). Super accessible by train! :) We come all the way from Flushing -- that's how yummy their food is :P",

From the very beginning, the team was attentive and caring, making sure every detail felt smooth and stress-free. On the day itself, the atmosphere was warm, beautiful, and intimate — exactly the kind of setting we had imagined for celebrating with our closest family and friends.\n\nThe food was outstanding. So many of our guests kept telling us how much they loved every dish, and we couldn’t agree more. It really felt like we were sharing a meal that was crafted with love and intention, which made it even more meaningful for us.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the way the staff handled everything with such calm professionalism while still being kind and personal. We never once had to worry about anything — they made sure we could actually be present and enjoy the day.\n\nBacchus will always hold such a special place in our hearts. We’re so grateful to everyone there for helping us create memories we’ll cherish forever.",

It felt effortlessly charming and photographed beautifully throughout the evening. Inside, the bar and dining area gave off that cozy, timeless feel you only really get from a true restaurant venue.\n\nThe staff was fantastic, organized, welcoming, and clearly experienced with events. And the food? Genuinely incredible. It's something we always notice when weddings are hosted at restaurants instead of traditional venues: the quality and consistency of the food are just on another level.\n\nThe guest count was around 150, and it felt like the perfect number for the space, everyone was comfortable, and nothing felt overcrowded.\n\nA really special spot for couples who want a celebration that feels personal, elegant, and food-focused. We’d go back in a heartbeat.",

Their food and drinks are truly incredible, change seasonally, and will always leave you dreaming for the next time you can return.\n\nWe have a special place in our hearts for Bacchus.

The Flaming Peking Duck is a true standout, not only for the impressive presentation but for the quality and taste that fully deliver. Paired with scallions, cucumber, and soft pancakes, it captures everything I love about authentic Peking duck.\n\nThe menu blends Asian and Latin flavors in such a creative way, making every dish feel bold and unique. I also loved the duck bone soup that comes with the meal; it’s comforting, flavorful, and the perfect complement to the duck. You can choose half Peking duck and half smoked duck or go for the full Peking duck which I definitely recommend.\n\nIf you’re a duck lover, Golden Wuish should be at the top of your list. The food, flavors, and overall experience truly make it worth the visit.",

By 6 pm, the restaurant was full, including seating at the bar.  There are only 6 two-tops, 6 seats at the bar and ?5 booths that can seat 6.  They do take names and numbers to contact later arrivals when a table opens.  Tonight, it was after 7 pm before one did.\nWe absolutely enjoyed our meal with an excellent 2006 Pomerol.  There was a large lag before our main arrived, and I forgot to take a picture until we had already dug in.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The Beef Tartare was prepared classically and was delicious.  The côte de boeuf was somewhat tough inn places, but the demi-glace was heavenly and made up for it.  It was served on the rare side of med.-rare.  I splurged on chocolate cake, and it was worth every calorie! (light and fluffy with excellent cocoa flavor).

The meal is ordered all at once and coursed out, allowing to be continuously one upped by the last item and be continuously impressed by the dishes. The appetizer dishes blew me away and somehow the food maintained or surpassed the quality at every turn.  Service was impeccable and very well informed on all the dishes, exactly what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. No weak points in this dinner at all. Highly highly recommend coming here if you are looking for an elegant and delicious meal that will blow you away, as long as you’re prepared to pay accordingly, but it will be worth it.",

    "text": "Not sure I quite understand the ‘hype’ around this restaurant. We were advised by our waitress to order 2-3 plates each (hors d’oevre, salad etc) and a main course. By ordering it all at the same time, the kitchen could plan our meal experience accordingly.\nHowever we only really wanted a main course each (and dessert) and were told that was fine but if we didn’t order a starter, we would have quite a long wait for our main courses.\n45 minutes later our main courses arrived (steak frites). No idea why it needed to take so long. We’d never had steak frites served this way (steak was pre sliced) and the steak was excellent, however the frites were luke warm at best and so crispy you couldn’t eat them with a fork. We mentioned this to the waitress who said ‘that’s how they’re supposed to be served’…..wrong. She did then go back to the kitchen and in due course we received a basket of perfectly cooked, hot frites, just as we were finishing our steak. Clearly the first batch had been regenerated and were not fresh. At $40 dollars a piece I would have expected better quality control from the kitchen. This totally spoilt our experience so we left without ordering dessert.",

    "text": "After a full week in New York—navigating a minefield of processed indulgences, seed oils, and dopamine-loaded distractions—Springbone wasn’t just a meal. It was a realignment.\n\nI walked in at the tail end of a 24-hour fast, gut inflamed, spine tense, and nervous system fried. What I found was clean fire—real food engineered for recovery, regeneration, and performance.\n\nI ordered the BBQ Chicken Bowl and the New Roots Beef Bone Broth. Here’s the breakdown:\n•\tThe Bowl delivered on all levels: clean protein from chicken breast, glycogen-replenishing sweet potatoes, cruciferous detox from cabbage and kale, and a kick of fermented brightness from pickled turnips. The BBQ sauce? Subtle, smoky, and not a sugar trap—flavor without compromise.\n•\tThe Broth was elite: grass-fed beef simmered into liquid collagen, infused with ginger, garlic, and vitamin C. It wasn’t just warm—it was ancestral. My gut thanked me. My brain rebooted. My joints softened their complaints.\n\nWhat hit hardest? This entire meal was free of seed oils, gluten, and refined sugar. It didn’t just nourish—it upgraded.\n\nIn a world full of food that numbs, Springbone fuels. Approved for all my clients because it honors the code: intellect, precision, optimization, evolution.",

FABULOUS!\nMine was Grandma's chicken with rice (roasted carrots & veggies) Yummy!  Wish I'd gotten the bone broth to add to the chicken, one trial of that was heavenly. It was a bit dry without the hot sauce added, I got that on the side but adding it made it amazing.\n\nLeftovers for 3 of us as a hearty snack later, 2 who hadn't been there, everyone really enjoyed it. And those 2 are picky.\n\nTwo workers there extremely nice.  One spoke English pretty well, though we had a small misunderstanding in the order, I caught it.  No big deal. She was so sweet helpful and efficient. Warm and kind person.  Other employee had little English, and was amazingly caring and attentive to her job and excellent, healthy delicious fast meals were provided to us and many others in short period of time. Most others were pickup or delivery, high volume handled well. For English speakers I recommend double checking the info and orders patiently and gracefully.  The intention to provide accurate excellent service is fully there, with the women we met.\n\nThis was yesterday, 6/26/24 around 7:45.

We ordered a chicken noodle soup, waffle, chicken triple decker with curly fries and a cup of coffee. Everything was great. It was what was needed to get some energy to head home.\nGlad we still can count on the court diner for 24hr food options.",

    "text": "With a diner-like appearance and colorful plates to add a southwestern palette, this place is like a Mexican / Diner hybrid. Upon entry, I noticed a cozy enclosed outdoor seating area, followed by a few steps up to the main entrance. Evening street parking was a breeze. Famished, we sat toward the back and commenced with two appetizers: guacamole with hearty tortillas chips (they don’t break when you scoop up the guacamole), and Choriqueso (melted cheese, chorizo, Picolo de gallo, guacamole, flour tortillas), I wasn’t crazy about the salsa, however, the guacamole was very good.\nI decided to try the Toro Narteño (grilled steak, jalapeño, pico de Galli, Monterey cheddar cheese). Which was very tasty, I found the jalapeño to be very fresh and crunchy, and My husband ordered the Enchiladas Suizas (pulled chicken, green salsa, corn tortillas, cheddar cheese, Monterey, Avocado, pickled red onions, rice & black beans). I didn’t like it at all, the tortilla tasted like it was made with all-purpose flour and the chicken was soggy. Rice and beans were ok. Our friend ordered the Burrito Classico (ground beef, shrimp, steak), he liked it. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. His recommendations for desserts that were made on premises were everything on the menu except the ice cream and mexican coffee cake. So we ordered the tres leches and the Mexican coffee cake (because I heard it’s made with mascarpone cheese! So it’s like tiramisù without the coffee). They really aced the Tres Leches. As a side note, if you have a sensitivity to msg, you should let them know because they do use adobo in their cooking.\n\n4 stars are for cleanliness, wait staff, appetizers and dessert.",

They have a vegetarian section and other options that can be made vegetarian. It’s a small spot, so I recommend checking in before heading there!",

Sandwich wasn’t horrible, a bit dry and had basic flavor but still edible (for $2 a bite of course) I just feel there shouldn’t be reviews or ravings of “known for huge sandwiches”. A huge sandwich should have me full or saving half for later. Im still hungry and Im definitely not a big back. I can appreciate great food for the price but this didn’t add up for me and I work all over the city to queens and brooklyn. Try it and form your own opinion of course but don’t go in with high expectations. I didn’t even have enough dressing to finish the other half of my sandwich.\n\nPs dont let the photo fool you, sandwich is barely 2 lbs Id say",

Let's talk about the food the Lamb Chops are legendary. We also love the French Onion soup , Prime Rib and Liver. Don't forget to leave room for desert and Irish Coffee !!  The Irish Coffee is fantastic !!",

The decor is stunning lots of warm tones, plants, and an overall design that feels both modern and cozy. There’s even a subtle smell of Palo Santo in the air, which adds a relaxing and unique touch to the experience.\nI tried the mariscos dish, which was excellent very flavorful and perfectly balanced. The fried calamari on top was a nice surprise that added great texture. The tuna with cantaloupe ceviche was another standout sweet yet acidic in just the right way, refreshing and layered with flavor.\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal, making sure everything was just right. The only thing I would have liked to see was a larger variety of non-alcoholic drinks, as that part of the menu felt a bit limited. Overall though, it’s a wonderful place to dine, and I’d definitely come back again.",

While the portions were substantial, the dishes were ultimately unremarkable and didn't offer anything particularly exciting or memorable. It felt a bit pretentious, with prices that seemed inflated for the quality of the food. This could be a decent choice for a special occasion where ambiance is a priority, but for a regular dining experience, it's not worth the cost. With so many incredible dining options in New York, this is likely a \"one and done\" for me. I'd prioritize trying other places before considering a second visit.",

It’s a refreshing start that feels effortlessly balanced.\n\nThe Heritage chicken is a standout dish that keeps me coming back. Featuring a fragrant ajwain gastrique and a velvety Vidalia onion soubise, this dish is pure perfection. It's so good that I, someone who rarely orders chicken at restaurants, find myself craving it regularly. That alone speaks volumes about its quality.\n\nI’m also endlessly impressed by their Romano Beans, available year-round.
